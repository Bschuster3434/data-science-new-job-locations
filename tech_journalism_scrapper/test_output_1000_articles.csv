This week the Chairman of the FCC and Google both seemed to come out in favor of holding wireless internet to the same network neutrality standards we hold the wired internet.,N/A,-1,-1
This has long been the goal of net neutrality advocates since back in 2010 when the FCC was writing the rules that would prevent last-mile broadband access providers from discriminating against traffic on their networks.,N/A,-1,-1
"After Google caved on the wireless issue, in what looked to be a realization that its business interests were tied to Verizon and others thanks to the nascent Android operating system, the FCC backed off the effort to make sure wireless networks were held to the same standards.",N/A,-1,-1
But the FCC and Google are apparently changing their minds.,N/A,-1,-1
"In a speech before the CTIA Tuesday, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler made a veiled threat to the wireless industry, saying:

He didn t come out and say the FCC was going to rethink how it views wireless in the net neutrality debate, but he certainly hinted that it was an option.",Wheeler,11,11
And many in DC are heartened by Wheeler s comments.,Wheeler,7,7
"Wheeler is really from the Ben Bernanke school of signaling before you do something crazy,  said Harold Feld, a lawyer with consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge.",Harold,17,17
"Wheeler is really from the Ben Bernanke school of signaling before you do something crazy,  said Harold Feld, a lawyer with consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge.",Wheeler,0,0
He is signaling that he is looking to up the rules on net neutrality on wireless.,N/A,-1,-1
Google apparently is too.,N/A,-1,-1
Jon Brodkin over at Ars Technica noticed earlier this week that Google is apparently back on the table as supporting network neutrality for both wireless and wireline access.,N/A,-1,-1
"That s a significant shift from its 2010 position, although Google didn t mention it in its most recent net neutrality filing from June 13.",N/A,-1,-1
"However, several internet lobbying groups such as the Internet Association and several tech firms (including Google) back in May have also made statements about bringing wireless back into the network neutrality discussion.",N/A,-1,-1
"So in light of Google s apparent volte-face and the Chairman s even more surprising almost-threat to the CTIA that the agency is looking at how network neutrality should play out on wireless networks, it s worth looking at what has changed since 2010

When the 2010 debate over network neutrality was raging, less than 30 percent percent of Americans had a smartphone, and they were using them very differently than they are using them now.",N/A,-1,-1
"During 2010, people in the U.S consumed an average of 350 MB/mo of data per month compared to 2013, when shared data plans and more devices helped push data consumption to 1.2GB per month, according to Chetan Sharma, a wireless industry analyst.",N/A,-1,-1
"Plus, as Sena Fitzmaurice, a spokeswoman for Comcast, pointed out, if more than 20 percent of visits to the internet are coming from mobile phones, a significant amount of eyeballs access the net via wireless networks, which means that any unfair deals would affect one in five attempts to get online.",N/A,-1,-1
Comcast says it is in favor of both wireless and wireline network neutrality.,N/A,-1,-1
"And then there are the people themselves, who are changing how politicians view the debate.",N/A,-1,-1
"Thanks to John Oliver s rant, the average consumer is far more engaged in the network neutrality debate than they were in 2010, and has told the FCC and her Congressmen what she thinks.",N/A,-1,-1
"Back in 2010 the carriers defended the need for wireless exceptions because wireless networks have far less capacity than wireline networks, and killing a carrier s ability to make special deals to guarantee high quality services would stop the development of things like remote medical monitoring.",N/A,-1,-1
"Four years, later, carriers aren t really offering new services, which has the FCC and others wondering why they made this exception.",N/A,-1,-1
"Plus, it appears that the FCC is even becoming skeptical of the congestion argument, as you can with with Wheeler s request to Verizon to justify the changes to its unlimited data plan.",Wheeler,21,21
"Well, ok, Rdio isn t actually dead.",N/A,-1,-1
But deals like the one T-Mobile recently signed to exempt the data used by customers accessing Spotify and Pandora streams from any data charges illustrate exactly what the FCC was trying to prevent when it built network neutrality rules.,Mobile,6,6
"In this case, consumers may benefit, but a service that s smaller and not part of the deal certainly won t. AT&T s sponsored data plan is another example, where companies can pay to exempt their content from AT&T customer s data usage.",N/A,-1,-1
Om called it an example of carriers seeking to charge both consumers and content providers and thought it reprehensible.,N/A,-1,-1
The FCC may also see it as a problem.,N/A,-1,-1
A favorite argument for people in favor of network neutrality is the success of Netflix.,N/A,-1,-1
"Since ISPs also offer paid TV services, they had every interest in discriminating against Netflix traffic, thus making it harder for a startup to compete.",N/A,-1,-1
"Now, as AT&T looks to acquire DirectTV and Verizon is consolidating a variety of online TV assets under the Redbox management, it s possible that mobile providers will have their own TV services.",N/A,-1,-1
"Even Netflix is getting in on the mobile game, which means that the same battles that played out on wireline networks could soon play out against on wireless.",N/A,-1,-1
"And finally there s the quesiton of Title II, the idea that instead of imposing network neutrality using a plan that basically guarantees paid prioritization on the internet the agency reclassifies broadband as a transportation service.",N/A,-1,-1
"Title II has gained ground with consumers and tech companies in recent weeks, and it s gone from the seemingly nuclear option to something that has really influenced the debate.",N/A,-1,-1
The carriers might be so afraid of Title II they will be willing to back down on wireless net neutrality as a way to placate the FCC and public.,N/A,-1,-1
"In short, our increasing reliance on mobile internet, the carrier s fear of additional regulations and the FCC recognizing the harm that a bifurcated internet could cause, are all behind this resurgence of interest in making wireless networks just as neutral as wireline networks.",N/A,-1,-1
Hopefully it won t mean that both networks get paid prioritization.,N/A,-1,-1
"There has been a flurry of activity in the cloud computing space in the few months, and in the past couple weeks in particular.",N/A,-1,-1
"Probably the biggest news, at least for people who ve been watching the space for years, is that HP bought private-cloud startup Eucalyptus and has made Eucalyptus s CEO, Marten Mickos (pictured above, at Structure 2012), the new vice president and general manager of HP Cloud.",N/A,-1,-1
"This is a pretty major move in the world of cloud computing software, where Eucalyptus was one of a handful of options   along with VMware, CloudStack (open source and the Citrix-supported version) and myriad OpenStack distributions   that enterprises wanting private or hybrid cloud environments had to choose from.",N/A,-1,-1
"There are some definite possible benefits of Mickos coming on board to try and transform HP s cloud strategy and technologies into something companies would want to buy, but there s also a not-to-clear plan in place about about will happen with the Eucalyptus technology.",N/A,-1,-1
"We had Mickos, along with HP CTO and director of HP Labs director Martin Fink and HP Cloud Senior Vice President of Product and Service Management Bill Hilf, on the Structure Show podcast to discuss the deal and what it means.",Martin,14,14
"You can, and probably should, listen to the whole thing.",N/A,-1,-1
But the HP-Eucalyptus deal was just one of a handful of big things that happened in the past couple weeks.,N/A,-1,-1
"We also saw Microsoft thoroughly embrace an open source project from Google, Google hire away Red Hat s CTO to head up its cloud business, and Citrix realign its cloud strategy after seemingly the entire CloudStack team, including its GM and the technology s creator, left the company.",N/A,-1,-1
"If I were a betting man, I still wouldn t bet on the private cloud approach really panning out, at least as it s currently being implemented.",N/A,-1,-1
"Next-generation stuff like containers, Kubernetes and Mesos, and Cloud Foundry, seem like a better approach in terms of the operational experience, including going hybrid.",N/A,-1,-1
They re already delivering results for the companies using them.,N/A,-1,-1
"I also think Google is going to make life a lot more difficult for everyone   Amazon Web Services, but also traditional enterprise cloud providers   as it tries to prove it s a legitimate option for all types of workloads and customers.",N/A,-1,-1
"However, as Barb Darrow and I discuss during the news segment of this week s podcast, the one company we haven t heard from lately is AWS, which is likely saving a cache of big news for its annual re:Invent conference in November.",N/A,-1,-1
"It s in vogue right now to say Google has backed AWS into a corner, but we ll probably see how true that really is in a couple months.",N/A,-1,-1
"If AWS can prove it s still an engine of innovation, including making its own push into the data center, then everyone will need to recalibrate their predictions once again.",N/A,-1,-1
"There has always been a lot of confusion in the private-cloud space, especially around OpenStack, and now there s a bit of consolidation happening, too.",N/A,-1,-1
"Companies like HP had better figure out a way to finally start selling their vision of cloud computing, or they re going to find there s no installed base to cling to when newer, shinier and arguably better options become ready for primetime.",N/A,-1,-1
Google Chrome is a great browser made even better by options for customization.,N/A,-1,-1
"What makes Chrome a really personal browser is the huge catalog of extensions that you can add to it, making your web experience even better.",N/A,-1,-1

"Despite the ambiguous explanation, it works quite simply: Click on its icon and add the site you re currently visiting to a HTTPS list.",N/A,-1,-1
Voila!,N/A,-1,-1
"Though some sites don t work with this extension, it s still great to have an additional defense line between you and hackers.",N/A,-1,-1
"If you want to go for a security overkill, consider using an alternative security-oriented browser, like WhiteHat Aviator, and add the above extensions.",N/A,-1,-1
Better safe than sorry.,N/A,-1,-1
"One of Google Chrome s early selling points was the sandboxing   each tab is a separate process, so if one tab crashes you don t have to restart the whole browser.",N/A,-1,-1
"Unfortunately, the more tabs you have open, the more RAM will be occupied, slowing down your computer.",N/A,-1,-1
The Great Suspender is a nice solution for users with dozens of tabs open.,N/A,-1,-1
"As the name implies, the extension suspends tabs that you don t currently need.",N/A,-1,-1

Chrono Download Manager replaces the standard Chrome download manager, giving you more control over the process while removing the standard Downloads Shelf.",N/A,-1,-1
"With this extension, you can pause, resume or make a queue of your downloads.",N/A,-1,-1
A batch downloads option lets you download all the files present on a webpage.,N/A,-1,-1
"Another option is Downloadr, which eliminates the need to go to the Downloads page in Chrome.",N/A,-1,-1
All the necessary control buttons are available from within the pop-up window.,N/A,-1,-1
"In other ways, it s very similar to Chrono.",N/A,-1,-1
"Unfortunately, none of the existing add-ons can make your files download faster, so heavy downloaders and users with slow internet connections should consider an overkill method for big downloads.",N/A,-1,-1
"Citrio, an alternative Chromium-based browser, has its own download manager.",N/A,-1,-1

Pixel-perfect screen designs have been a trademark of native iOS development from day one.,N/A,-1,-1
A tradition that with the introduction of new iPhone screen sizes may have to give way to adaptive screen design across the platform.,N/A,-1,-1
Native iOS developers tend to cater to specific devices mores than mobile web and Android developers.,N/A,-1,-1
"But when the number of variances in screen sizes gets out of control, all you can do is gravitate more towards an adaptive or responsive approach in your app s design.",N/A,-1,-1
"Prior to the iPhone 6, there have been very few screen size differences to contend with in the iOS world compared to Android.",N/A,-1,-1
"When looking at the screen dimensions for each of the different iPhone models supported by iOS 8, only the iPhone 4S supports a 3:2 aspect ratio.",N/A,-1,-1
"The iPhone 5, 5C, 5S as well as the new iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus all support a 16:9 aspect ratio.",N/A,-1,-1
"Moving from the iPhone 4 to the iPhone 5, Apple kept the pixel width of the different screens constant at 640.",N/A,-1,-1
"It was the pixel height that changed from 960 to 1136, which transitioned the iPhone from a 3:2 ratio to 16:9.",N/A,-1,-1
"With the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus, both the width and the height changed keeping the aspect ratio fixed at 16:9 across all iOS 8 supported iPhones, except the iPhone 4S.",N/A,-1,-1
The shorter dimensions of the iPhone 4S compared to the other iOS 8 supported iPhones makes it more difficult to support when it comes to screen design.,N/A,-1,-1
"Simply put, designs don t scale well when crossing over to a different aspect ratio.",N/A,-1,-1
But this is not a new challenge for iOS developers to contend with; this has been a part of iOS 7 development all along.,N/A,-1,-1
"As a result, there are still some iOS 6 apps out there that do not conform to the 16:9 screen dimensions of the iPhone 5 and center themselves on the screen, leaving blank black bars of dead space across the top and bottom of the device.",N/A,-1,-1
"The good news about the screen dimensions on both the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus is that all of the effort put into redesigning apps to take full advantage of the iPhone 5 screen size will, for the most part, scale nicely on both the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus.",N/A,-1,-1
"Out of the gate, Apple has made every effort to keep apps that were specifically redesigned in iOS 7 for the iPhone 5, 5C and 5S to look as good as possible in iOS 8 on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.",N/A,-1,-1
"The auto-scaling capabilities built into iOS will look better than the letter-boxing effect app owners had to deal with as developers redesigned their screens from the 3:2 aspect ratio inherent to the iPhone 4 and 4S to the taller, more slender 16:9 ratio of the iPhone 5.",N/A,-1,-1
"Meaning, if you buy a device with a larger screen, you will actually get to use the larger screen.",N/A,-1,-1
That does not mean that similar to the  Designed for iPhone 5  app updates of 2012 and 2013 we will not start seeing  Designed for iPhone 6  updates to our favorite apps.,N/A,-1,-1
There is more screen real-estate to potentially design for.,N/A,-1,-1
"In particular, icons, graphics and other UI elements will now need to support the @1x, @2x and the recently introduces @3x pixel sizes, otherwise things might start to look a bit blurry.",N/A,-1,-1
Mostly iOS developers will have to learn to take advantage of some of the new Adaptive Layout features in iOS and keep their screen designs more flexible rather than pixel perfect.,N/A,-1,-1
"Designing apps that adapt will likely be the standard for apps targeting the iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 screen sizes, but the iPhone 6 Plus may prove to be a bit more of a challenge.",N/A,-1,-1
What is likely to prompt developers to redesign some of your favorite iPhone apps will be the changes introduced by the iPhone 6 Plus and its enhanced support for landscape mode.,N/A,-1,-1
Many iPhone specific apps lock their orientation to portrait mode.,Many,0,0
You may have noticed that these particular apps do not rotate when you told your screen.,N/A,-1,-1
"This is primarily because in many scenarios on the iPhone, landscape mode just does not have enough space to design a decent app.",N/A,-1,-1
"With the iPhone 6 Plus s larger screen, Apple has started supporting the home screen in landscape mode as well as a more iPad-like split view for iPhone 6 Plus apps.",N/A,-1,-1
"This will likely require some major updates to customize the user experience on the iPhone 6 Plus, especially when designing app extensions.",N/A,-1,-1
The time it will take to redesign portrait-only screen layouts of an iPhone only app could equal that of transition to a universal app that also supports the iPad.,N/A,-1,-1
"While supporting a wider variety of screen sizes may be new to iPhone developers, it certainly is not new to Android developers.",N/A,-1,-1
"The latest information from Open Signal shows that as a platform, Android has become increasingly more fragmented each year when it comes to the number of manufactures, different devices, OS versions and variances in screen sizes.",N/A,-1,-1
"There were 18,796 distinct Android devices this year compared to 11,868 last year and only 3,997 in 2012.",N/A,-1,-1
Keeping track of all of the different screen resolutions on Android can in itself be a full-time occupation.,N/A,-1,-1
An interesting dynamic that was added to Open Signal s analysis of the fragmentation data this year was the discovery of a correlation between the market share of the top five devices in a give market segment and that country s gross national product per capita (GDP/Capita).,N/A,-1,-1
"The data shows that the higher the GDP/Capita, the less fragmentation there is in that country.",N/A,-1,-1
"As an example, here in the U.S. the top five Android devices represent forty-five percent of the market.",N/A,-1,-1
That drastically cuts down on the number of devices one has to consider supporting compared to Madagascar where the top five devices represent only eight percent of the overall Android market.,N/A,-1,-1
"Apple may have just introduced a third category for asset densities within in an iPhone project (@3x), in contrast Android supports six generalized screen densities (dpi, mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, and xxxhdpi).",N/A,-1,-1
"The goal for Android developers is to achieve what is referred to as density independence, basically avoiding situations that make graphics, buttons and icons appear oversized on different screens.",N/A,-1,-1
And that s a situation that iPhone developers will now have to contend with.,N/A,-1,-1
"Cloudbees  decision to drop its PaaS, or platform as a service, to focus on continuous integration and delivery is a bit like a car maker deciding to stop building cars to focus on building assembly lines instead.",N/A,-1,-1
The analogy is imperfect but you get the picture.,N/A,-1,-1
Continuous integration is a software engineering method which requires the merging of all working copies of a piece of software into a shared mainline or trunk repository as the project continues.,N/A,-1,-1
"In traditional software development, integration happened infrequently or at the end of the process, which often led to all sorts of problems getting various pieces of the application to work together.",N/A,-1,-1
"Cloudbees CEO Sacha Labourey (pictured above) said Jenkins, an open-source continuous integration (CI) product, has been a focus for a while, but now it is the sole focus as Cloudbees helps PaaS customers move to Cloud Foundry, Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku etc.",Jenkins,9,9
"The reason for this change of plans (or, ugh, pivot)   In the last two years the market as started to shift from continuous integration to delivery and what s interesting is that Jenkins is not only used by developers any more but is becoming the hub where dev, devops and IT people meet.",Jenkins,36,36
"It is where you define your end-to-end pipeline, from source repositories to Chef and Puppet deployments   it becomes your big IT orchestrator, and as such becomes as critical as your production environment,  he said.",N/A,-1,-1
And the Jenkins ecosystem has boomed.,Jenkins,2,2
"Where there were 200 plug-ins a few years ago there are now at least 1,000, he said.",N/A,-1,-1
"And, it doesn t hurt that Google has embraced Jenkins for use with Google Compute Engine and Google App Engine.",Jenkins,10,10
"Cloudbees  founders came from Jboss, now part of Red Hat, which gives them a good idea of which open-source projects can support a business, Labourey added.",N/A,-1,-1

"It works, it has a huge ecosystem, it s gaining traction and is an extremely important element in continuous delivery,  he noted.",N/A,-1,-1
He also felt it was striking that there wasn t a enterprise-grade licensed version of the tool already available.,N/A,-1,-1
But this move also brings up the long-simmering question of whether a full PaaS is overkill for most companies.,N/A,-1,-1
"A full PaaS encompasses a set of integrated set of services   for database, load balancing, continuous delivery etc.",N/A,-1,-1
that developers use not just to build and test applications but to deploy them once that is done.,N/A,-1,-1
"Schneider said Jenkins  narrower focus makes it an easier sell because the CI tool is typically selected and paid for out of the same application development budget, whereas PaaS can require buy-in from many more stakeholders.",Jenkins,2,2
The countervailing argument is that companies are just not ready for continuous delivery   by Jenkins or any of its competitors   yet.,Jenkins,14,14

That means Android app developers don t have to modify their software to get it on Chromebooks.,N/A,-1,-1
"However, they may need to optimize their app so that it works better with trackpads and keyboards.",N/A,-1,-1

Why  C Spire CEO Hu Meena put it rather succinctly: The FCC still owes him a rather large check.,N/A,-1,-1
C Spire is sitting on $200 million worth of 700 MHz spectrum auction in 2008 that it has simply been unable to use.,N/A,-1,-1
"C Spire, like many rural and regional carriers, bought licenses in a portion of the 700 MHz band called the A block, expecting to fully participate in the LTE revolution of the last several years.",N/A,-1,-1
It was sorely mistaken.,N/A,-1,-1
"Verizon Wireless and AT&T essentially carved out private little empires in their portions of the 700 MHz band, over which their devices   and their devices alone   would work.",N/A,-1,-1
Many smaller carriers like C Spire and U.S. Cellular found themselves stranded on their own island of 4G spectrum called Band 12.,Many,0,0
And if their networks don t interoperate with the big carriers that means the devices they use are incompatible as well.,N/A,-1,-1
"To this day, Apple still hasn t built an iPhone that works on a Band 12 network, despite commitments from AT&T and Sprint to back interoperability.",N/A,-1,-1
"C Spire, U.S. Cellular and other carriers have managed to circumvent the problem by building their own LTE networks on the PCS bands or partner with Verizon and Sprint to lease their spectrum.",N/A,-1,-1
But when you ask Meena about this temporary fix he just fumes.,N/A,-1,-1
"While he s proud that C Spire able to provide its customers in the southeastern U.S. with LTE services, he s furious that he has to dip into his 2G and 3G spectrum to do so.",N/A,-1,-1
He wants to use the 4G airwaves his small company paid hundreds of millions of dollars for six years ago.,N/A,-1,-1
"The other carriers on the panel   U.S. Cellular, Bluegrass Cellular, SI Wireless and nTelos   weren t in C Spire s exact same predicament, but every single one of them could relate.",N/A,-1,-1
"The 600 MHz auction in 2015 may present a big opportunity for carriers of all sizes to get the spectrum for future mobile broadband networks, but in their minds it also presents another big opportunity for the big carriers and the FCC to screw over the little guy.",N/A,-1,-1
They all want assurances from Chairman Wheeler that that won t happen.,Wheeler,6,6

The Alice case itself involved a patent that described the ancient concept of escrow implemented on a computer.,Alice,1,1
"The Supreme Court affirmed a long-standing rule that abstract ideas can t be patented and, importantly, added that simply using a computer processor to carry out the idea didn t change that fact.",N/A,-1,-1

As Ananny and Crawford point out, one of the players at the center of this debate is Facebook, since the massive social platform is a source of news for a large number of users   and therefore the algorithms it uses, and the design choices it makes, have a powerful influence on what news users either see or don t see.",Crawford,45,45

"In interviews with senior players at Storify, Zite and other services, they found that most of them see their role as finding the signal amidst the noise:

A Zite co-founder said that one of the biggest benefits of an app that learns from users is that it can help show editors what news  should be  instead of what they might think it is.",N/A,-1,-1

"If they become a  partner,  for $24 a month, they get a discount on tickets as well as the ability to book their tickets in advance and watch livestreams of the events.",N/A,-1,-1
"And for $97 a month they can become a  patron,  and get special access to private events and  unique experiences  not open to other members.",N/A,-1,-1
"The Guardian isn t the only newspaper to offer a form of membership, with different benefits based on how much they contribute: the Wall Street Journal offers something called WSJ+ to paying subscribers, which gives them access to invitation-only talks by experts on various topics, as well as special events like museum tours, or discounts on a round of golf at a private course.",Wall,25,25
"The New York Times also offers something called  Premier,  which gives subscribers who pay extra access to special features, including behind-the-scenes interviews with journalists.",York,2,2

"As Ken Doctor notes in a post at the Nieman Lab blog, a number of media companies are also investing heavily in live events, since some success stories such as Atlantic Media s dramatic turnaround have shown that events can be a significant draw for readers, and can generate additional revenue.",Atlantic,32,32
"As Ken Doctor notes in a post at the Nieman Lab blog, a number of media companies are also investing heavily in live events, since some success stories such as Atlantic Media s dramatic turnaround have shown that events can be a significant draw for readers, and can generate additional revenue.",Media,33,33
"But what makes The Guardian s approach a bit different, I think, is the sheer scale of what they are talking about, and how the events tie together with the membership model.",N/A,-1,-1
"It s not just one or two events   the British paper is spending a large sum to renovate the former Midland Goods Shed because it plans to host dozens of daily or weekly events, from the small to the large.",Midland,20,20
"In a sense, it is going into the conference business in a big way.",N/A,-1,-1
Is that risky  Sure it is.,N/A,-1,-1
"What those live events accomplish, as Rusbridger notes when talking about the open-house weekend, is that they deepen and extend the relationship with readers, a relationship that the Guardian editor notes is the most important thing the paper has   more important than its relationship with advertisers, and certainly more important than a relationship with shareholders.",N/A,-1,-1
"As he puts it:

The bottom line is that this relationship with readers is the core of whatever value newspapers have in this digital age   it s not their ability to print things on paper, or drop objects off at your house.",N/A,-1,-1
It s their status as a trusted source of information and content that is relevant to you and your life.,N/A,-1,-1
"And the more they get to know you, the more valuable that relationship becomes.",N/A,-1,-1
"I ve written a number of times before about membership-based models like the ones at Talking Points Memo and Techdirt, and how the best of those models replicates what is happening in the music industry: namely, a focus on a deep relationship with fans, and deriving revenue from that instead of focusing on selling access to a specific unit of content or a specific physical product.",N/A,-1,-1
I think the Guardian is smart to dive into that model in a big way.,N/A,-1,-1

"Seven months ago, I sat in in Chevy Corvette pushing buttons on what was supposed to be General Motors  next generation infotainment system.",N/A,-1,-1
"The new MyLink was intended to bring a bevy of new entertainment, information and lifestyle apps into the Chevy dashboard, all accessible from GM s own app store.",N/A,-1,-1
And an LTE radio embedded in the Corvette s roof was intended to be the primary source of connectivity for all content brought into the vehicle.,N/A,-1,-1
AppShop never made it into the Corvette nor any of GM s new 4G cars released this summer.,N/A,-1,-1
"Nor did promised apps like NPR, Slacker Radio, Kaliki, Glympse or Priceline.com (the exception is Pandora) roll off the lot along with new GM models.",N/A,-1,-1
What happened  GM has abandoned its strategy of making its embedded infotainment systems the central development platform and OS for most apps in the car.,N/A,-1,-1
"I sat down Mary Chan, GM President of the Global Connected Consumer, at CTIA Wireless this week where she candidly acknowledged that GM s connected car strategy will be dramatically different.",N/A,-1,-1
"Instead of trying to bring every app and service to market itself, GM is leaning heavily on its new partners Apple and Google to bring core infotainment apps to the dash and relying on the smartphone to supply the connectivity for those apps.",N/A,-1,-1
"Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are both user-interface layers that run on top of automakers  own infotainment operating systems, essentially projecting a driver-optimized version of popular apps from the smartphone onto the dashboard screen.",N/A,-1,-1
"So instead of downloading a separate version of Spotify or Google Maps for your car, you can use the same app in your phone, interacting with it using the car s touchscreen controls or buttons.",N/A,-1,-1
"We always knew GM was going to use Android Auto and CarPlay in some form to buff up the content in its Chevy MyLink, Cadillac Cue and Buick/GMC IntelliLink systems.",Cadillac,25,25
But the strategy Chan describes goes much further.,N/A,-1,-1
"With some exceptions, GM is basically handing over development of any app that isn t directly tied to the vehicle s core driving capabilities over to Apple and Google.",N/A,-1,-1
"Take audio streaming apps, for instance.",N/A,-1,-1
"There are hundreds of apps delivering music, talk radio, podcasts, audio books and any other conceivable type of audio content.",N/A,-1,-1
"To bring all of those apps to every car s infotainment system would be a nightmare for both developers and automakers, requiring direct integration and optimization of each individual app into dozens of different operating systems.",N/A,-1,-1
"Those apps, however, are already in Google Play and the iTunes store, and since they require very little of the car s hardware resources to function   basically the display and audio speakers   only a few development tweaks would be necessary to optimize them for potentially hundreds of vehicle makes and models using CarPlay or Android Auto.",N/A,-1,-1
"And since they would run on the phone and use its radios for internet connectivity, customers could use them without subscribing to a separate connected car data plan.",N/A,-1,-1
"Those types of applications are great applications to be brought into the car with the smartphone,  Chan said.",N/A,-1,-1
The types of apps we want to focus on are the ones that require a much deeper integration with the vehicle.,N/A,-1,-1
"Those apps are the services that need to delve into GM s connected car APIs, accessing engine data, taking readings for the car s growing bevy of sensors or tapping into its telematics systems.",N/A,-1,-1
"GM s OnStar Remote Link is a perfect example: it tracks the health of the car, monitors fuel or battery levels and supports features like remote door unlock and engine start from a smartphone.",N/A,-1,-1
CarPlay and Android Auto s limited integration with the car means it can t perform those complex tasks.,N/A,-1,-1
"GM s development program isn t going away, Chan said.",N/A,-1,-1
But its focus has definitely narrowed.,N/A,-1,-1
"What we should expect to see is many more apps from GM and its partners focused on things like remote monitoring, road safety and car location.",N/A,-1,-1
Some specialty entertainment apps might not be out of the question either.,N/A,-1,-1
"For instance, Gracenote is working on music algorithms that could tie listening selections to the vehicle or driver s mood, for instance playing more upbeat music when the car is cruising on a wide-open highway or more introspective music when its raining (as indicated by the car s windshield wipers).",N/A,-1,-1
Those types of apps will need to tap more deeply into GM s APIs.,N/A,-1,-1
"GM also needs to provide options for customers who don t have Android or iOS phones, and its developer program will remain open to more general lifestyle apps for that reason.",N/A,-1,-1
"GM also said that the AppShop will eventually debut in GM cars to distribute those apps, though it gave no details on the timing.",N/A,-1,-1
"In my opinion, GM s move is a very smart one.",N/A,-1,-1
Its previous connected car approach put too much pressure on GM to build a big app ecosystem; something it or any automaker isn t equipped to do.,N/A,-1,-1
It also required drivers to buy often expensive data plans from a single carrier AT&T (GM also announced at CTIA that it would bring OnStar 4G connectivity to Europe under its Opel brand).,N/A,-1,-1
"AT&T will still supply connectivity for OnStar systems and GM s own homegrown apps, but drivers will no longer be required to sign up for a data plan to access services like streaming.",N/A,-1,-1
"The new approach is actually similar to that of Ford, which has taken a smartphone-centric bring-your-own-connectivity approach since it first launched Sync AppLink.",Ford,9,9
"The difference is Ford still requires developers to work within its development framework, while GM is turning much of that work to Google and Apple (Ford also has signed up to use CarPlay and Android Auto in some limited fashion).",Ford,3,3
"The difference is Ford still requires developers to work within its development framework, while GM is turning much of that work to Google and Apple (Ford also has signed up to use CarPlay and Android Auto in some limited fashion).",Ford,27,27
So what precipitated GM s change of heart  Chan said it was timing.,N/A,-1,-1
"Automakers have long development cycles and when GM was developing its infotainment strategy, CarPlay and Android Auto didn t even exist as concepts.",N/A,-1,-1
"Both programs were only officially announced at Google s perspective developer events this year, and it was around that time that GM decided to switch gears, Chan said.",N/A,-1,-1
The only drawback is that new GM car buyers will find their cars a lot less connected than originally promised.,N/A,-1,-1
Pandora is available in the MyLink system and will connect to the Pandora app in your smartphone.,N/A,-1,-1
"GM has its OnStar navigation and assistance apps, XM radio and a hotspot router that will let you to distribute the car s LTE connection to other devices via Wi-Fi.",N/A,-1,-1
"But if you were hoping for a bevy of apps, you ll have to wait until CarPlay and Android Auto are officially available in GM cars, and GM is remaining mum about when that will be.",N/A,-1,-1
There s a good possibility that the new MyLink and Cue systems in 2015 model cars will be able to get them with a software upgrade.,N/A,-1,-1
"This post was update on Friday, Sept. 12, to clarify the headline and add more details about the future of the GM s AppShop and developer programs.",N/A,-1,-1
"While much of GM s car app development will shift to CarPlay and Android Auto, MyLink and GM s other infotainment brands Cue and IntelliLink won t disappear.",N/A,-1,-1
They will remain the core operating systems and primary user interfaces in its vehicles.,N/A,-1,-1
"In regions without mobile broadband, or where it s still too expensive to have a data plan, other ways to connect to the web are always welcome.",N/A,-1,-1
"Say hello to Cosmos Browser, which provides web access using SMS so that you can view web pages without using Wi-Fi or even a lowly 2G network.",Cosmos,3,3

"On Thursday, though, it seemed as if Byliner found a somewhat happy ending: Vook (see disclosure), a New York-based company that offers digital publishing services to authors and organizations, announced it had acquired Byliner.",New York,23,24
The deal may be good news for Byliner authors who wondered how they were going to get paid: Vook said Thursday that it would be paying them 85 percent royalties on works that were already for sale at digital retailers like Amazon and Apple.,N/A,-1,-1
"That is a different financial model than the one used by Byliner, which paid authors a flat fee and then split royalties with them 50-50.",N/A,-1,-1
It s unclear what will happen to authors who were under contract with Byliner but whose works weren t yet published by the time things at the company fell apart.,N/A,-1,-1
Those authors were presumably promised upfront payments that they may or may not receive from Vook.,N/A,-1,-1

"Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Eucalyptus had raked in something like $55 million in venture funding since it was founded in 2010.",N/A,-1,-1
"Some estimate that HP may have paid up to $100 million for Eucalyptus, its IP and some 70 employees.",N/A,-1,-1
"In an interview, the executives didn t provide much detail about integration plans, but stressed that Eucalyptus brings valuable experience in deploying private clouds that interoperate with Amazon Web Services to HP and that those AWS  use patterns  will come in handy as HP continues to push its OpenStack-based private, public and hybrid cloud vision into enterprise accounts.",N/A,-1,-1
HP wants to be seen as having the broadest set of cloud deployment options for enterprise accounts.,N/A,-1,-1
"But that s a hotly contested demographic, where it must contend with Red Hat and IBM on the OpenStack side of the spectrum and VMware and Microsoft on the proprietary cloud side.",N/A,-1,-1
"Bill Hilf, SVP of product and service management for HP Cloud, summed it up:

Our strategy is really not to say we ll only have public or private offerings and we believe the lines between all those continue to blur and at least for enterprise workloads, most of them over next few years will be on-prem clouds or hosted private clouds.",N/A,-1,-1
That s the sweet spot we target and Eucalyptus brings with it not just AWS interop but general skills in that market.,N/A,-1,-1
"OpenStack continues to be our core platform and along with that what we re doing with Cloud Foundry at the dev/PaaS layer and with AWS interoperability, we ll be the only vendor with that breadth of choice along with hardware, software and services around that to help customers build their clouds.",N/A,-1,-1
"Over the past year, Fink said HP has become  the number one OpenStack contributor    a claim Red Hat would probably dispute.",N/A,-1,-1
"HP is  committed to open source and the open cloud promise and bringing Eucalyptus on board that remains the same,  he noted.",N/A,-1,-1
"Mickos was once a pretty harsh critic of OpenStack, which shows promise but remains a work in progress comprising many sub-projects and modules that someone needs to put together.",N/A,-1,-1
"At Structure 2012, he likened it to the  Soviet Union of cloud  because it had so many corporate backers nothing ever seemed to get accomplished.",Union,10,10
But in recent months he s been more conciliatory.,N/A,-1,-1
"At Structure this year, Mickos, then-Citrix exec Sameer Dholakia (representing CloudStack), and Nebula CTO Chris Kemp (standing in for OpenStack), mutually agreed that open-source cloud coexistence was preferable to sniping.",Kemp,20,20
"Then in August, Mickos agreed to speak at an OpenStack event, which got the spidey senses tingling.",N/A,-1,-1

"For whatever reason, OpenStack seems to have won the marketing war for open source cloud.",N/A,-1,-1
"With Eucalyptus now part of HP, you have to wonder about the fate of the other smallish open-source cloud companies going forward.",N/A,-1,-1

"A recent trademark application indicates that it will be called YaVeo, which translates to  Now I see.",N/A,-1,-1
DirecTV CEO Mike White first mentioned that his company was interested in launching niche online services in an interview with Reuters late last year.,White,3,3
"At the time, White mentioned that a Spanish-language service could be an opportunity for DirecTV, but also added that it was too early to announce any details.",White,4,4
"However, by that time, development of the new service was already well under way, including partnerships with technology providers, according to sources.",N/A,-1,-1
"In February, DirecTV posted a job offer further describing the service, which reads in part:

DIRECTV is building a new organization focused on streaming media services (Over   The   Top Content or OTT).",N/A,-1,-1
That will revolutionize entertainment landscape by providing more content that will be available on more screens than ever.,N/A,-1,-1

Of course, there is always a possibility that DirecTV could change course last minute and use a different brand, or scrap plans for the service altogether.",N/A,-1,-1
"A DirecTV spokesperson declined to comment on specifics, and instead sent me the following statement:

However, going after a Spanish-language audience makes a lot of sense for DirecTV.",N/A,-1,-1
"Not only is the size of this audience growing as part of demographic shifts in the U.S., Latinos also watch 90 minutes more online video per month than the average U.S. consumer, according to a recent Nielsen report.",N/A,-1,-1
"Focusing on Spanish-language content will also help DirecTV avoid directly competing with either Netflix or traditional TV services, both of which can be very expensive.",N/A,-1,-1

"With its Chaos Engineering initiative as a possible remedy, Netflix wants to hire engineers whose sole purpose is to constantly scout for errors in its massive distributed infrastructure while developing new tools that can figure out how resilient Netflix s infrastructure really is.",N/A,-1,-1
"While this may sound similar to the company s Simian Army of tools developed by Netflix to simulate failures in its AWS environment in order to better prep for the actual emergencies, Chaos Engineering takes it a step further by having an actual methodology in which engineers are personally in charge of running simulations of the Netflix environment and looking for ways to break the system.",N/A,-1,-1
"Besides creating new tools that simulate crashing the systems so Netflix can figure out possible real-world examples of what may go wrong on a given day, the Chaos Engineering team will also be responsible for creating better system designs for Netflix s infrastructure to handle unforeseen failures.",N/A,-1,-1
Ideally distributed systems are designed to be so robust and fault-tolerant that they never fail.,N/A,-1,-1

Chromebooks just got a lot more interesting because Android apps now run on the Chrome OS laptops.,N/A,-1,-1
"Google first announced an experiment to get Android software on its Chrome OS devices back in June, even showing off one of them on stage.",N/A,-1,-1
"Details were scant at the time but on Thursday, Google shed more light on the process: It built special software that runs on top of Chrome OS called the Android Runtime for Chrome.",N/A,-1,-1
This runtime is the secret sauce for getting the Android apps to run on a non-Android device.,N/A,-1,-1
"ArsTechnica asked Google about the details and got this response:

The app code is all running on top of the Chrome platform, specifically inside of Native Client.",N/A,-1,-1
"In this way the ARC (Android Runtime for Chrome) apps run in the same environment as other apps you can download from the Chrome Web Store, even though they are written on top of standard Android APIs.",N/A,-1,-1
"The developers do not need to port or modify their code, though they often choose to improve it to work well with the Chromebook form factor (keyboard, touchpad, optional touchscreen, etc).",N/A,-1,-1
The ARC is a beta at the moment and Google appears to be taking the process slowly.,N/A,-1,-1
"Today there are just four Android apps available in the Chrome Web Store: Evernote, Vine, Duolingo, and Sight Words.",N/A,-1,-1
Google said it will work with select Android developers as the ARC continues to mature.,N/A,-1,-1
"In theory, any Android app could run on a Chromebook via ARC without the app developer porting or modifying the software.",N/A,-1,-1
"However, Android apps are designed with touch in mind and not every Chrome OS device has a touchscreen, for example.",N/A,-1,-1
"In these cases, a developer would need to modify the input methods to work with mouse, trackpad and/or a keyboard.",N/A,-1,-1
"Regardless, the Android Runtime for Chrome opens up a possibility that many Chromebooks owners have long dreamed of: Getting more apps on their devices.",N/A,-1,-1
"Obviously, we ll have to see how the ARC pans out for users and developers alike, but the idea of adding hundreds of thousands of existing Android apps to Chromebooks strengthens the case for Chrome OS as a way for Google to sway people away from traditional computer operating systems such as Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X.",N/A,-1,-1

"According to blog post author Kay H. Brodersen, Google uses the tool   created it, in fact   primarily for quantifying the effectiveness of AdWords campaigns.",N/A,-1,-1
"However, he noted, the same method could be used to gauge everything from whether adding a new feature caused an increase in app downloads to questions involving events in medical, social or political science.",N/A,-1,-1
"Here s how Brodersen describes CausalImpact in the blog, first at a high level and then in some more detail.",N/A,-1,-1
"The blog post has a deeper explanation of the package, as well as instructions for installing it via GitHub:

 In practice, estimating a causal effect accurately is hard, especially when a randomised experiment is not available.",N/A,-1,-1
One approach we ve been developing at Google is based on Bayesian structural time-series models.,N/A,-1,-1
We use these models to construct a synthetic control   what would have happened to our outcome metric in the absence of the intervention.,N/A,-1,-1
"This approach makes it possible to estimate the causal effect that can be attributed to the intervention, as well as its evolution over time.",N/A,-1,-1
The CausalImpact R package implements a Bayesian approach to estimating the causal effect of a designed intervention on a time series.,N/A,-1,-1
"Given a response time series (e.g., clicks) and a set of control time series (e.g., clicks in non-affected markets, clicks on other sites, or Google Trends data), the package constructs a Bayesian structural time-series model with a built-in spike-and-slab prior for automatic variable selection.",N/A,-1,-1
"This model is then used to predict the counterfactual, i.e., how the response metric would have evolved after the intervention if the intervention had not occurred.",N/A,-1,-1
The differences between causation and correlation   and the importance of not conflating the two just because you re now dealing with big data   has been explained ad nauseam.,N/A,-1,-1
"And although all of those concerns hold true, especially if we re using data to solve a problem or to inform policy strategies that could have meaningful negative effects on individuals, this type of tool is still potentially very useful.",N/A,-1,-1

News broke last week that NASA is building an air traffic control system for unmanned aerial vehicles that could affect everything from Amazon s delivery drones to agricultural drones.,N/A,-1,-1
It turns out that it s not working on the project alone: San Francisco drone startup Airware is helping.,San Francisco,13,14
"Airware head of global business development and regulatory affairs Jesse Kallman provided a few more details on the scope of the project, including that NASA and Airware will test many different types of drones with the system.",N/A,-1,-1
"The features of the software they will develop are not yet decided, but they will test aircraft spacing, collision avoidance and trajectory modeling.",N/A,-1,-1
"Early on, the system will require human involvement, Kallman said.",N/A,-1,-1
But eventually it will be automatic.,N/A,-1,-1
The drones and air traffic control system would check in with each other and make decisions about flight times and paths on their own.,N/A,-1,-1
The network would not blanket the entire U.S.,N/A,-1,-1
"Instead, it would only cover areas that are likely to have congested drone traffic, Kallman said   likely cities and agricultural and industrial zones.",N/A,-1,-1
"The network could also be quickly deployed in a new area, including in the case of an emergency.",N/A,-1,-1
"The end goal is   it s an automatic system that knows how to manage airspace and traffic in the area,  Kallman said.",N/A,-1,-1
Maybe it s not a permanent fixture in that area.,N/A,-1,-1
"But on demand, you could set something up and now you could have more of a congested operations environment in a new place.",N/A,-1,-1
"Kallman said NASA and Airware are already working on the system, and will likely keep working on it for four to five more years.",N/A,-1,-1
"That should carry into the time commercial drones are expected to be legalized in the U.S.

 Obviously a lot of people are frustrated with regulations in the U.S. and the speed things are going,  Kallman said.",N/A,-1,-1
I think it s great to   develop the system and help the FAA look at alternatives for how to operate small systems at low altitudes. ,N/A,-1,-1

Cable giants Comcast and Liberty Global have signed a deal that will allow Liberty s broadband customers to use Xfinity wireless hotspots in the U.S. and Comcast customers to roam onto Liberty s Wi-Fi network in European countries.,Cable,0,0
It s a significant deal since both have extensive Wi-Fi footprints.,N/A,-1,-1
"Comcast now has 3 million hotspots, while Liberty runs of a network of 2.5 million Wi-Fi nodes.",Liberty,8,8
"The reasons both their networks have grown so big, though, is that Comcast and Liberty customers are the ones actually running the Wi-Fi access points.",Liberty,16,16
Both Comcast and Liberty have adopted crowdsourcing approaches to their hotspot networks.,Liberty,3,3
"Any customer who uses one of their routers is actually running two networks, a private home network for their use only and a public network that any Comcast or Liberty customer can access.",Liberty,30,30
"The two cable operators have essentially tasked their customers to build their network for them, and in exchange those customers get free access to results.",N/A,-1,-1
What s interesting about this agreement is it s the first that we know of in which Comcast is inviting outsiders onto the network.,N/A,-1,-1
"Not just your Xfinity-using neighbors, but Liberty s European customers can now use that network to avoid high cellular roaming costs when traveling in the U.S.",Liberty,7,7

"First, Stevens, as CTO of Red Hat, was a great advocate for open-source cloud in general and OpenStack in particular.",N/A,-1,-1
"And Google, which bases a bunch of its internal IP on open source technology but has been criticized in the past for not contributing back on par with other vendors, has a complicated relationship with open source.",N/A,-1,-1

"Savant is releasing Savant App, a beautiful and intuitive app that allows consumers to control lighting, thermostats, audio-visual gear and more.",N/A,-1,-1

"Does the world really need a new blogging platform  Haven t we already moved beyond that, thanks to platforms like Facebook and Twitter and Google Plus  Perhaps   but not everyone believes that s a good thing.",Haven,9,9
"Some early bloggers have moved back to personal publishing in recent weeks, and now advocates of the so-called  indie web  are launching open-source blogging software called Known, which is designed to give everyone a fully open publishing platform.",N/A,-1,-1
"Known provides what looks like a regular blog, but with a variety of open-source standards and plugins that allows users to cross-post or distribute their status updates, photos, videos and other content to networks like Twitter, Facebook and Flickr with a single click.",N/A,-1,-1
"They can also pull comments or responses from those networks back into their blog, using an open standard called WebMentions.",N/A,-1,-1
"The platform, which consists of both open-source blog software that users can install themselves and a hosted version   similar to WordPress (see disclosure)   launched as a public beta on Thursday morning.",N/A,-1,-1

"Said Werdmuller:

Although blog software such as WordPress also allows anyone to control their own home on the web   and can give them similar cross-posting features through the use of plugins   Werdmuller said that it and other older tools are still difficult for many novices to use, and while they have had features bolted on to an aging code base, Known (which is funded in part by Matter Ventures in San Francisco) was designed from the ground up to be fast and to cross-publish to social networks.",San Francisco,74,75
"While the idea of an  open web  strikes many people as a good thing, Werdmuller said Known isn t counting on sheer passion to sell people on the software.",N/A,-1,-1
"Other open-web efforts   including OpenSocial, which Google helped develop as an alternative to the Facebook Platform, as well as OpenID and others   have failed in part because they didn t solve a crucial need.",N/A,-1,-1
"In contrast, Werdmuller says Known has gotten interest from educational groups and universities   many of whom are now partners in developing the software   because they see it as beneficial for their students to have a home of their own online where they can post their coursework as well as interact with other students.",N/A,-1,-1
"So just as Known integrates with Twitter and Facebook, it also integrates with educational platforms like Moodle.",N/A,-1,-1
"In fact, Known can integrate with any service that has a public API   all it takes is for someone to write a plugin and upload it to Github, the open-source repository where Known makes its software available.",N/A,-1,-1
"To illustrate just how open it is, the toolbar on a demo of the software includes an icon called  chicken,  ready for someone to write a plugin that applies to fowl.",N/A,-1,-1
"One of Known s advisors is Kevin Marks, a longtime open-web advocate who has worked for Apple and Google.",Marks,7,7
"Along with Mozilla Web standards lead Tantek  elik, Marks has been a core member of the IndieWeb movement since it began, and has even developed his own software standard called Fragmentions, which allows web-browser software to link to specific parts of the text on a website, instead of just the top of an article or blog post.",Marks,9,9
"In addition to the IndieWeb group, there are others who are actively trying to break down the reliance on proprietary platforms   including blogging pioneer Dave Winer, who has developed his own publishing software for posting to a blog and cross-posting to Twitter and Facebook, known as Radio3.",N/A,-1,-1
"Winer s software will even update a Facebook post automatically when the original blog post is edited, a feature that Winer worked on with Facebook after the giant social network contacted him.",N/A,-1,-1
"Whether publishing tools like Known or Winer s software can gain any traction with web users remains to be seen, but if nothing else they provide an alternative to the dominance of corporate-controlled networks like Facebook and Twitter, and that s a good thing for the open web.",N/A,-1,-1

"Earlier this year, a Raleigh, N.C.-based cloud company called 6Fusion signed a deal with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world s biggest market for commodities and derivatives contracts.",Raleigh,5,5
"If all works out, the deal will mean that buyers and sellers of cloud computing services can do business on a spot exchange and, in a few years, trade derivatives too.",N/A,-1,-1
"The exchange will be a place to buy hours of  WAC,  a term invented by 6Fusion that stands for Workload Allocation Cube.",N/A,-1,-1
The idea behind the WAC is to create a standard unit of cloud computing infrastructure that can be bought and sold by the thousands.,N/A,-1,-1
"Under 6Fusion s current definition, a WAC hour is composed of six metrics, including ones related to compute, networking and storage, that can be sold at a single price.",N/A,-1,-1
"Here is how 6Fusion portrays a WAC:

According to 6Fusion spokesman Ryan Kraudel, the WAC is akin to a watt of power because it provides a standard measure of output, which in turn removes barriers to trading cloud computing as a commodity.",N/A,-1,-1
"The fundamental problem no one s been able to solve till now is  what is the barrel or bushel  [of cloud]  Now, there s a basis for contracts in the future of infrastructure services,  said Kraudel.",N/A,-1,-1
6Fusion is not the only one proposing such an arrangement.,N/A,-1,-1
"In Europe, a company called Zimory is working with the German exchange Deutsche Boerse to sell cloud computing units.",N/A,-1,-1
"In theory, the creation of these common metrics means companies can now use forward or futures contracts, based in WAC s, to exercise more control over IT costs, which represent a growing percentage of many corporate budgets.",N/A,-1,-1
Kraudel predicts that IT-intense enterprises like banks or universities will be among the first adopters.,N/A,-1,-1
"What this could mean on the ground is that the IT infrastructure of a company like JP Morgan could soon consist of private cloud servers for sensitive data, supplemented by public cloud supplies purchased from an ever-changing roster of third party cloud computing providers.",Morgan,17,17
"At the same time, such purchases of cloud computing  by the bushel  would also mean lower prices as traders, rather than vendors, start to set the price of key ingredients of IT infrastructure.",N/A,-1,-1
"Skeptics might note that this idea of cloud computing brokers has been around for a while, but now its arrival finally appears close at hand.",N/A,-1,-1
"Kraudel says a spot exchange for bilateral contracts should be running by the end of the year, and that a derivatives market will be up and running by late 2015 or 2016.",N/A,-1,-1
"But that doesn t mean, of course, those markets will succeed.",N/A,-1,-1
"The idea of WAC s, and a derivatives market for IT infrastructure, is well and good in theory, but that doesn t mean it s actually going to happen.",N/A,-1,-1
"6Fusion can define WACs and the Chicago Merc can provide a place to sell them, but the plan will only work if a critical mass of buyers and sellers agree they are worth trading.",Chicago,6,6
And that could be a challenge.,N/A,-1,-1
"Unlike a barrel of oil or a bushel of wheat, there is no consensus on what a commodity unit of cloud computing should look like.",N/A,-1,-1
"While 6Fusion has offered a definition, not everyone will accept it and some will challenge the choice of metrics that make up a  WAC hour.",N/A,-1,-1
"The task of defining the  cloud bushel  is harder still since the industry is evolving rapidly, and even accepted references points like an M3 instance from Amazon, may be soon outdated.",N/A,-1,-1

We re still only halfway there since an exchange also needs sellers.,N/A,-1,-1
"And right now, the cloud infrastructure industry is dominated by a giant called Amazon Web Services that will likely be reluctant to offer up its wares to a commodity exchange.",N/A,-1,-1
"The reason is that commodities, by definition, are interchangeable and sold at a price lower than any one seller can dictate.",N/A,-1,-1
"So for Amazon, which is already selling cloud infrastructure at fire sale prices, a commodities exchange would not only depress prices further, but invite a host of other competitors to replace its branded AWS products with a generic bushel.",N/A,-1,-1
"But one way to prevent that from happening is for Amazon, and other big cloud service providers like Rackspace or Microsoft, to simply sit this out and try to ensure the commodities is not liquid enough to be viable.",N/A,-1,-1
"6Fusion s Kraudel acknowledged that Amazon, which declined to comment for this story, would be reluctant to participate, and noted that the company already offers its own on-the-spot cloud pricing as well as a form of futures called  reserve instances.",N/A,-1,-1

"This will be the startup s last funding round before it considers a possible IPO, said its CEO Bob Brennan.",N/A,-1,-1
What makes Veracode different than the recent torrent of security startups that have been raising cash is how its technology aims to strengthen the development process of applications rather than providing network-monitoring services like RiskIQ or identity management features like Okta.,N/A,-1,-1

"Many applications don t take into account today s  hostile environment  caused by hackers who seemingly cause major breaches each week, explained Brennan.",Many,0,0
"The rise of agile and more rapid development life cycles has also caused the chances of developers overlooking security holes to increase, especially when it s often the case that developers and the operations staff responsible for overseeing security are separate from each other.",N/A,-1,-1
"The world views of security and development are different; one is focussed on building things and one is focussed on monitoring,  Brennan said.",N/A,-1,-1
Veracode works by hooking into the development tools used by coders so its cloud-based system can scan their application for vulnerabilities or bugs in the code.,N/A,-1,-1
Veracode looks for problem spots based on a set of policies that a company sets up to make sure the code adheres to its standards.,N/A,-1,-1
"We get deeply embedded in the build process so we are like air,  Brennan said.",N/A,-1,-1

"Apple may have succeeded at breaking two records at once with the free release of U2 s latest album via iTunes yesterday: The album, titled Songs of Innocence, instantly became  the largest album release of all time,  as Apple CEO Tim Cook announced on stage during the company s iPhone 6 event.",Cook,45,45
"But now, it looks like it s also on track to become one of the worst music publicity stunts of all time.",N/A,-1,-1
"To turn Songs of Innocence into a record release, Apple decided to add it to every iTunes user s music library without asking.",N/A,-1,-1

"The new service, called the Microsoft Azure Media Services Indexer, is the materialization of a Microsoft Research project called MAVIS.",Media,8,8
"The way the indexer works is to listen to a user s content and extract keywords as metadata, which can then be used for a variety of things.",N/A,-1,-1
"Search is the probably the most obvious one, but the metadata could also be used to categorize content or, Microsoft claims, add descriptions or captions to it.",N/A,-1,-1

"Kevin Tofel thinks that s a possibility and the watch has both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and some uncertain amount of storage.",N/A,-1,-1
It also can help provide important context about the user when it comes to building home scenarios.,N/A,-1,-1
"With the sensors built in, the watch can presumably tell if you are sleeping or awake, which means it could notify your house when you get up (at the very least it would know when you take it off the charger).",N/A,-1,-1
At that point it could offer to turn on lights or initiate some wake up sequence.,N/A,-1,-1
"But given the tinge of the marketing around this yesterday (as Kevin noticed, Apple didn t mention the word smartwatch once), Apple may not be ready to add context derived from the watch to the smart home.",N/A,-1,-1

"Calling landline numbers in continental Europe via Hangouts, for example, is now as little as $0.01 per minute, whereas making these calls via Google Voice or Google Talk used to cost $0.02 per minute.",N/A,-1,-1
"All of this is part of making Hangouts the centerpiece of Google s messaging efforts, which traditionally been scattered across a number of apps and services.",N/A,-1,-1

"Atlassian s Jira Service Desk 2.0 debuts Wednesday with a new centralized portal that displays multiple service desks across a big business and a view into each agent s workload, among new perks.",N/A,-1,-1
But probably most important is that Atlassian has blown up the per-user pricing model announced last year and which went over like a lead balloon.,N/A,-1,-1
"A month after last year s inaugural Jira Service Desk release, an Atlassian blog post addressed and apologized for the move.",N/A,-1,-1
"The company said it wanted service desk price to be consistent with the existing add-on price model for the rest of its portfolio but was rethinking the move:

Atlassian products are almost all priced in a user-count way.",N/A,-1,-1
None of our products distinguish between  active  users (such as service desk agents) and  passive  users (such as those who would only report tickets).,N/A,-1,-1
"However, since launch, we ve clearly heard that many customers require a licensing model based on the number of agents, rather than the number of issue reporters.",N/A,-1,-1
"Now, nearly a year later, the company has instituted agent-based pricing starting at $20 per month per agent if the company has 3 agents or less.",N/A,-1,-1
If the company has 4 agents or more the cost per agent per month is $25.,N/A,-1,-1
That means an agent can serve a dozen or 100 customers but not have to pay for each of those users.,N/A,-1,-1
"We got pushback from many customers because they wanted to use it widely and across many end users at their companies,  said Didier Moretti, general manager.",N/A,-1,-1
"As to how many users one agent can support, the answer is all over the map, depending on the tech needs and skills of the organization itself.",N/A,-1,-1
We have customers with one agent for less than 100 users and others 1 for 200.,N/A,-1,-1
"Larger, more established sites can have higher rations, one customer recently told me 1 agent for more than 1,000 users,  Moretti said via email.",N/A,-1,-1
"Jira Service Desk competes with products from BMC, ServiceNow and ZenDesk.",N/A,-1,-1
"Until recently, the use of this type of product was pretty much limited to IT support staff, but now other departmetns   human resoruces, procurement, finance   are starting to use the technology to support their own constituencies.",N/A,-1,-1
"With that adoption, the per-user pricing announced last year stung.",N/A,-1,-1
One Gigaom commenter at the time lambasted  the pricing.,N/A,-1,-1
With the new pricing model a 25 person team servicing 500 or 1000 client log-ins has to upgrade to 500 or 1000 Jira licenses.,N/A,-1,-1

"Yesterday, Apple introduced the Apple Watch.",N/A,-1,-1
"And though it won t ship until next year, it s already ruling the headlines.",N/A,-1,-1
Gigaom Research wants to know your initial impressions of this new device and your thoughts on its potential impact on smartwatches and wearables in general.,N/A,-1,-1
Earlier this year Apple added a spec to its MFi program for third-party accessory makers that described using the proprietary Lightning cable to connect a pair of headphones.,N/A,-1,-1
"On Wednesday, the first pair of Lightning-equipped headphones was announced, and they re not from Apple subsidiary Beats, they re made by Woox Innovations under the Philips brand.",N/A,-1,-1
The headphones are called the Philips Fidelio M2L and they will cost  250 ($323) when they go on sale in Europe this December.,N/A,-1,-1
"The headphones emphasize audio fidelity, using the Lightning cable to bypass the iPhone s built-in digital-to-analog converter in favor of a 24-bit DAC included in the headphones themselves.",N/A,-1,-1
"This theoretically promises higher quality sound, but I suspect it will appeal to only a small percentage of audiophiles, especially considering the Apple iOS Music app does not support high-definition music.",N/A,-1,-1
"In order to get the most out of these headphones, users will have to install a music app that supports 24-bit lossless files, like VLC.",N/A,-1,-1
"It also doesn t seem as if the Fidelio M2L has taken advantage of some of the potential that the Lightning connection unlocks, such as the ability to power the headphones   for features like active noise cancellation   from the device itself.",N/A,-1,-1
"There are a lot of interesting new headsets that are integrating wearable technology, such as Samsung s vibrating Gear Circle, but that device is wireless using Bluetooth.",Circle,20,20
"SMS Audio s new heart-rate sensing earbuds can draw power from a conventional 3.5mm audio jack, but I suspect they could do a lot more if they used a Lightning cable.",N/A,-1,-1
"The plugged-in, powered connection afforded by the Lightning cord could be a big deal for wearable technology on your head, which is why it s disappointing that the first iOS-only headphones are geared toward audio quality.",N/A,-1,-1
"This probably won t come as a great shock, but apps are generally pretty bad at telling you what they do with your personal information.",N/A,-1,-1
"In fact, a survey by the Global Privacy Enforcement Network, a group of privacy regulators from around the world, found that 85 percent of the 1,200 surveyed apps don t clearly explain why they collect personal data, how they use it and who they share it with.",N/A,-1,-1
"Other findings: Almost a third of apps seem to request more permissions than necessary; 59 percent  left users struggling to find basic privacy information ; and 43 percent either bury key information in lengthy privacy policies or provide it in tiny, non-mobile-friendly print.",N/A,-1,-1
"Simon Rice, tech chief at the U.K. Information Commissioner s Office (ICO), said the ICO and other regulators would write to developers  where there is clear room for improvement  and publish guidance to help people protect their information when using apps.",Rice,1,1
"Meanwhile, Canadian Privacy Commissioner Daniel Therrien said those conducting the survey were left uneasy by apps that  were requesting permission to access potentially sensitive information, like your location or access to your camera functions, without necessarily explaining why.",Canadian,2,2
"Do users care about this stuff  I suspect they do, though the mobile OS vendors  permissions policies tend to make everything a game of all or nothing.",N/A,-1,-1
Look at the incredibly privacy-friendly App Ops tool that Google quietly launched then pulled   it would have let users toggle fine-grained permissions   and consider how it could have mitigated the outrage that hit Facebook s Messenger app a few weeks back.,N/A,-1,-1
"Trust will become an ever more important issue when it comes to sending data off to the cloud, and ultimately you re going to find startups touting their privacy credentials as a marketing tool.",N/A,-1,-1
"Europe s data protection regulations will force them to be more up-front anyway, so they may as well play the honesty card sooner rather than later.",N/A,-1,-1
"As Therrien put it:  Both large and small app developers are embracing the potential to build user trust by providing clear, easy to read and timely explanations about what information they will collect and how they will use it.",N/A,-1,-1
Others are missing that opportunity by failing to provide even the most basic privacy information. ,N/A,-1,-1

"Last week CartoDB introduced its developer program, suggesting that  the future of geo is going to be an ecosystem of apps that serve many different use cases.",N/A,-1,-1
"As de la Torre explained it to me:

We started purely with developers and moved to data scientists and more information professionals, and now the next situation of our product is that anybody can make maps.",N/A,-1,-1
Part of the investment goes on the development of our tool   we re hiring a lot of user experience designers  I believe not a single application will do everything that s required on GIS [geographic information systems].,N/A,-1,-1
The future of geo is not one application with a million buttons but a million apps with one single button.,N/A,-1,-1
You re going to see us investing in the power of the community of spatial developers to make better apps.,N/A,-1,-1
"So, for example, a water management company might have a dedicated GIS department to aid its mapping efforts, but that information might not be immediately useful to someone on the company s business intelligence side.",N/A,-1,-1
"They might want to know what will happen if you cut a pipe in a particular place,  de la Torre said.",N/A,-1,-1
"Before, they d have to ask someone to make a report.",N/A,-1,-1
Now it can be done with a very simple web application.,N/A,-1,-1
"Similarly, retailers may use another CartoDB-based application to find the location for the next shop, based on spatial demographics.",N/A,-1,-1
"Developers would write apps to address these various needs and sell them through CartoDB s marketplace, sharing the revenue with CartoDB.",N/A,-1,-1
"The reason we re doing it is not only because we believe it s a good revenue source, but we believe the future of GIS mapping and location-based services is going to be more in customized applications,  de la Torre said.",N/A,-1,-1

It s great that most software vendors now profess a mobile-first strategy.,N/A,-1,-1
The problem is that many companies still rely on existing Windows applications   written for the desktop   to run their businesses.,N/A,-1,-1
"Making those applications suitable for use on tablets and smartphones is the sticky problem that Reddo Mobility, a spin-out of Gizmox announced Wednesday, promises to attack.",N/A,-1,-1
Gizmox offers HTML5 tools for developers.,N/A,-1,-1
Reddo Mobility incorporated some of that IP into software that companies can use to  mobilize  those desktop apps without coding.,N/A,-1,-1
"Non-coders can bring apps down from the servers, break down the components and adapt them for use on smaller form factor devices.",N/A,-1,-1
The target apps can be custom-built or commercial applications (although not the Windows Office productivity suite).,N/A,-1,-1
"Users can add swipe and tap capabilities to screens originally designed to work with keyboards and mice, for example.",N/A,-1,-1
Other screens may not need alterations.,N/A,-1,-1
"Right now, if companies want to bring their desktop apps to other devices, they either have to rewrite the app completely   a time, cost and resource sink   or they can do a  screen scrape,    la Citrix, and push the results down to the device.",N/A,-1,-1
"That s problematic, said new Reddo CEO John Vigeant (a Citrix veteran who was most recently CEO of Tracelytics), because the resulting app won t support swipe and doesn t look right.",N/A,-1,-1
"Gizmox closed $7.5 million in funding in April 2013 from backers including Atlas Ventures, IVC, Consolidated Investment Group and, yes, Citrix, bringing total funding till that date to $18 million.",N/A,-1,-1
"Today is the day that Netflix, Reddit and others are taking part in  internet slowdown day  to protest the FCC s proposal to create special  fast lanes  on the internet.",N/A,-1,-1
"To draw attention to the issue, many participants are displaying  spinning wheel  icons, such as the one appearing on site Etsy on Wednesday:

The Etsy website, and those of others involved in the protest, are not loading any differently than usual, but are displaying the spinning wheel to invoke the frustration of slow internet speeds.",N/A,-1,-1
"The participants hope the gesture will spur users to voice their displeasure to the FCC about the  fast lane  plan, which would permit broadband providers like Comcast to give special treatment to partners or to websites that pay a toll.",N/A,-1,-1
"The protest has attracted support from dozens of companies, including Twitter and Kickstarter, and earned attention from the BBC and the Wall Street Journal.",Wall,23,23
"Still, it feels like the whole thing has come up a bit flat   especially compared to a landmark day in 2012 when the internet  went dark  to protest a planned anti-piracy law called SOPA.",N/A,-1,-1
"That 2012 protest shook Washington, and SOPA died soon after.",Washington,4,4
"Internet slowdown day,  in contrast, so far seems unlikely to have similar reverberations.",N/A,-1,-1
"The most obvious reason is that many of the big names that took part in the  stop SOPA  protests   notably Google, Facebook and Wikipedia   are sitting this one out.",N/A,-1,-1
"Their absence could deprive the fast lane opponents of the attention, momentum and money that will likely be needed to make the FCC change course.",N/A,-1,-1
"In the case of Google, the company s absence from  internet slowdown day  could be because the proposed alternative to fast lanes, known as  Title II reclassification,  could crimp the company s own ambitions for its Fiber network.",N/A,-1,-1
"As for Wikipedia, another key partisan in the SOPA fight, the top of its webpage does not feature a spinning wheel atop its page, but instead the usual plea for money.",N/A,-1,-1

"Salesforce.com plans to add a new data center  in France, working with service provider Interxion.",N/A,-1,-1
"The facility is one of three new data centers the company is adding in Europe to support local customers and, the company said, it will be completely powered with (unspecified) renewable energy.",N/A,-1,-1
"In May, the SaaS kingpin said it was working with NTT Europe on a new U.K.-based data center to open later this year.",N/A,-1,-1
That would be its sixth data center overall.,N/A,-1,-1
At that time Salesforce.com CEO and Chairman Marc Benioff said Europe was the company s fastest growing region for fiscal 2013.,N/A,-1,-1
A third data center will open in Germany later this year.,N/A,-1,-1
None of the public statements about all this new capacity mentioned growing demand from European countries that data centers serving their citizens be local.,N/A,-1,-1
Part of that is due to worries over latency but much of the sentiment has been growing since Edward Snowden s disclosures about NSA and the U.K. s GCHQ data snooping.,N/A,-1,-1
"The feeling, which may not be quite rational, is that snooping is harder if local data resides locally, not in the U.S. Data should be safer from official inspection by the U.S. authorities if it is not stored there, but a U.S.-owned company may still be liable to turn that data over when requested, no matter where it is stored.",N/A,-1,-1
"Additionally, the NSA has many international spy agency partners that snoop locally and pass information to it.",N/A,-1,-1
"The company now has five data centers in the U.S. and Toyko, a spokeswoman said.",N/A,-1,-1
"We also  announced we ll be opening a new data center in Canada and three European data centers, located in the U.K., France, and Germany.",Canada,12,12
"The data center in the U.K. will open this fall, with France and Germany to follow in 2015.",N/A,-1,-1
Clearly the race is on by cloud players   including Saas and IaaS companies   to add to their geographic reach.,N/A,-1,-1
"Public cloud leader Amazon Web Services, for example, runs all of Europe out of its Dublin facilities but has indicated that a German data center is in the cards   an AWS Re:Invent announcement perhaps  Germany and Switzerland have arguably the strictest data sovereignty laws on the books.",Dublin,17,17
"Cloud vendors now know that to operate at true scale, they have to run everywhere, said IDC software analyst  Al Hilwa, via email.",N/A,-1,-1
"And, he noted, that any hope cloud vendors might have entertained about keeping  minimal geographic presence is vanishing as the post-Snowdon effect suggests that cloud presence might have to be won country by country.",N/A,-1,-1
Only players with enormous scale are going to be able to invest in this way to establish global synergies.,N/A,-1,-1
"Those words reiterate what  Battery Ventures Technical Fellow Adrian Cockcroft noted at Structure 2014 in June when he stressed that location really, really matters for cloud providers going forward.",Adrian,8,8

"365 Data Centers is also looking to develop additional features within the data center for its clients, like backup systems, managed servers and managed firewalls; 365 Data Centers could potentially acquire a company whose technology can help it achieve those goals, said Scanlon.",N/A,-1,-1
"While the company has some of those features available for clients in its Emeryville facility, it wants to develop more features and roll them out in all of its data centers.",Emeryville,13,13
"What you find is that customers bring their core computing gear into the data center, then they look at the data center manager to provide other services,  said Scanlon.",N/A,-1,-1
"What separates 365 Data Centers from other data center colocation companies like Internap or Equinix (365 Data Centers acquired 16 facilities from Equinix when it was founded) is the startup s focus on small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), as well as its take on pricing, said Scanlon.",N/A,-1,-1
"Whereas most data center colocation companies rely on locking clients into long-term contracts, 365 Data Centers charges clients on a monthly basis, similar to what the cloud providers like Google or Amazon do.",N/A,-1,-1
"The data center is the last thing to move off from that long-term, arduous 30-page contract,  said Scanlon, in reference to how the pricing models for IT and computing have changed over the years, with more services letting users simply click a button and sign up instantly.",N/A,-1,-1
"Even though 365 Data Centers specializes in physical facilities, Scanlon believes that many SMBs want hybrid data centers, in which they can maintain their content using their own equipment while also being able to tap into cloud-based applications like those provided by Salesforce.com or use a cloud provider for remote storage.",N/A,-1,-1

We ll surely hear more as we get closer to the early 2015 product launch.,N/A,-1,-1
"By not calling it a smartwatch, Apple can define the device they way it sees fit.",N/A,-1,-1
But I m already seeing some of the same challenges that current smartwatches face.,N/A,-1,-1
"Do we even know what we want a smartwatch to do 

Apple thinks it does.",N/A,-1,-1
The Apple Watch is a companion device; one that works with iPhones.,N/A,-1,-1
"Obviously, it tells the time.",N/A,-1,-1
There will be third-party apps for it and you can use it for navigation   I especially like the different haptic feedback bits that signal a left or a right turn when used with the Maps app.,N/A,-1,-1
"There is continuous heart rate monitoring, exercise tracking and fitness goals:that s a big heath focus.",N/A,-1,-1
You can ask Siri questions.,N/A,-1,-1
And you can send iMessages or even communicate watch to watch with your friends.,N/A,-1,-1
"But all of that gets me back to the idea: What is a smartwatch  By that I mean, do people want another screen just to get at most of the same apps, data and activities that are already available for the phone they ll need to have with them anyway 

Here s a perfect example: When you favorite a photo on your iPhone, it will automatically be made available on your Apple Watch.",N/A,-1,-1
"While that s interesting from a technology perspective, will people want to show off those pictures on a small screen wrapped around their wrist 

I had a related thought when capturing a video demo of the Apple Watch interface.",N/A,-1,-1
"While Apple has done a great job with the overall software design, there are still several taps, touches and twists to get at certain features.",N/A,-1,-1
"At some point, it s just simpler to pull out the phone and do what needs to be done.",N/A,-1,-1
Check the video and see if you agree.,N/A,-1,-1
"Notifications on the wrist at a glance are handy, so that I can appreciate.",N/A,-1,-1
There s no contextual aspect to those notifications like Google Now for Android Wear   at least not that we know of   but even a watch built around the useful Google Now service isn t enough for me to spend $200 or more for a smartwatch at this point.,N/A,-1,-1
And Apple s new watch starts at $349 with premium options costing some additional fee.,N/A,-1,-1
There are several examples of Apple redefining markets.,N/A,-1,-1
"It did so with the iPod and digital music and then again with the iPhone, which came to define the current generation of smartphones.",N/A,-1,-1
"A smartwatch, however, is still a bit of an enigma.",N/A,-1,-1
Nobody has cracked the code that makes the device highly desirable by most people.,N/A,-1,-1
"Instead, we ve seen a shift of screens from phone to wrist along with the required interface tweaks because it seems like the next thing to do when it comes to mobile technology.",N/A,-1,-1
"Don t get me wrong: I think Apple has designed an interesting, fashionable device.",N/A,-1,-1
"The idea of taking a traditional, familiar watch element   the crown   and using it to zoom without obscuring the watch display is clever.",N/A,-1,-1
It s a feature that I could see some smartwatches  borrow  in the future.,N/A,-1,-1
"But overall, the Apple Watch faces the same complications as competing devices in terms of battery capacity and usefulness.",N/A,-1,-1
"After all, you still need your phone with you and for many tasks, it s likely going to be the better device.",N/A,-1,-1
"You still have taps, swipes and button presses to get around on a watch, so why cram them onto a smaller screen when it s more comfortable on a larger one for the same functionality 

The company has definitely put its stamp and design chops on the smartwatch, even if it s not calling it a smartwatch.",N/A,-1,-1
There s also a big focus on health and fitness here.,N/A,-1,-1
"And for those reasons, it will surely appeal to some customers in early 2015.",N/A,-1,-1
"Barring surprise features though, at this point I m still not sure Apple has provided tens of millions a compelling reason to get their first smartwatch, even if it comes from Apple and isn t called a smartwatch at all.",N/A,-1,-1

The number of companies trying to sell connected speakers seems to be growing by the week as the holiday season approaches.,N/A,-1,-1
"Without listing each and every speaker, its best to think of them as being part of four major camps.",N/A,-1,-1
"Team AllPlay Will the future of home audio could be defined by a chip maker  Qualcomm is definitely trying, and has thrown its hat in the ring with its own technology solution dubbed AllPlay.",N/A,-1,-1
"Last week, Qualcomm announced that Monster will use AllPlay to power its first line of internet-connected speakers, and crowdsourced Wi-Fi operator FON will add AllPlay-compatibility to its new Gramofon social music router in the coming months.",N/A,-1,-1
(We have Fon COO Alex Puregger at Structure Connect and will ask him more about his company s plans for Gramofon.,Alex,5,5
") AllPlay is still missing some major music services, including Pandora, and it looks like its initial focus will be more on Europe than the U.S.",N/A,-1,-1
"However, Qualcomm is in this for the long haul, as the company not only hopes to sell its chips to loudspeaker makers, but also wants to use the speaker as a kind of trojan horse to bring connectivity to other devices.",N/A,-1,-1
"We are building AllPlay with the internet of things in mind,  Qualcomm s Product Management Director Gary Brotman told me during a recent interview.",Gary,17,17
"Brotman not only cited the obvious example   making your devices talk to you through your speakers   but also other possible applications, which could include sending album art to your TV, or synchronizing your connected lightbulbs with your music playlists.",N/A,-1,-1
"Team Play-Fi Qualcomm s AllPlay is getting some competition from Play-Fi, a wireless audio solution developed by DTS, which is probably best known for powering audio systems in theaters.",N/A,-1,-1
"DTS differs from AllPlay in that it wants to take a different approach to how the audio system interacts with mobile devices: Eventually, DTS hopes to partner with carriers and handset manufacturers to gets its software directly embedded into your phone s system, making it capable of routing any audio to your speaker   think of it like Bluetooth, but without the reach problem.",N/A,-1,-1
"However, it may take some time before these products come together.",N/A,-1,-1

"The company has been defining the category with its own hardware, and struck partnerships with all the major music services.",N/A,-1,-1
"Sonos has been slow to open up and offer others access to its SDK, and there is no interoperability between Sonos speakers and those made by other manufacturers.",N/A,-1,-1
"That insular approach, which can be compared to Apple s way of doing business, has so far helped Sonos.",N/A,-1,-1
"Consumers know that Sonos products will definitely work with other Sonos products, and once they buy into the ecosystem, they re poised to buy more Sonos speakers as they connect additional rooms in their house.",N/A,-1,-1

"Sonos CEO John Macfarlane will join us on stage at Structure Connect next month as well, and we will make sure to ask him about his thoughts on all these new competitors.",N/A,-1,-1
"The rest of the pack Aside from Sonos, AllPlay and Play-Fi, there are likely more than a dozen other companies in the market pushing their own devices and standards.",N/A,-1,-1
"Some of these are big names; Samsung has its own multiroom audio strategy, as does Sony.",N/A,-1,-1
"Others are upstarts looking to differentiate themselves with unique takes on connected audio, like Beep with its click-wheel that brings Pandora to every speaker in the house or Aether with its smart Cone that promises to learn from your music listening.",N/A,-1,-1
"And then there are companies like Pure that aren t household names in the U.S., but that are backed by big companies and that partner with CE manufacturers like Onkyo to capture a piece of the market.",N/A,-1,-1

"Pure combines Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to ease consumers and music services into the new, connected world, Aether is attempting to reinvent the user interface for music, and Beep has teamed up with Pandora to push for open standards for connected audio devices.",N/A,-1,-1
"With all these contenders, shopping for speakers could get complicated this coming holiday season, which is why many people may opt for the brands they know, be it established speaker manufacturers like Polk or connected speaker pioneer Sonos.",N/A,-1,-1

"In fact, the TV industry s lobbying arm, the National Association of Broadcasters, has gone to the courts trying to get the auction stopped.",N/A,-1,-1
The NAB is challenging it on grounds that broadcasters who choose to remain on air won t have their signals protected when the band is rearranged for 4G services.,N/A,-1,-1

This is not easy to accomplish when data is physically far from where it is needed.,N/A,-1,-1
"In the past decade, with the exponential growth of internet, remote connectivity, and, later, large quantities of data, lack of bandwidth has become a major issue.",N/A,-1,-1
A first generation of wide area network (WAN) optimizing solutions appeared in the market with the intent of overcoming the constraints of limited bandwidth connectivity.,N/A,-1,-1
"Sophisticated data-reduction techniques like compression, deduplication, traffic shaping, caching, proxying, and so on were integrated to minimize traffic between data centers and branch offices or for DC-to-DC communication.",N/A,-1,-1
"WAN optimization can contribute significantly in improving the quality and the quantity of services delivered to branch offices, replicate storage at longer distances for disaster recovery (DR) or business continuity (BC), reduce WAN costs, and improve mobile connectivity.",N/A,-1,-1
Recently things have changed significantly.,N/A,-1,-1
Traditional WAN optimization was mainly conceived for solving lack of bandwidth in a time when legacy protocols were designed for local area network (LAN) connectivity.,N/A,-1,-1
"Data was neither compressed nor encrypted, and computers were unable to manage huge amounts of complex data.",N/A,-1,-1
"Now things are the other way around: High-bandwidth links (10Gbs or more) are considerably cheaper than in the past, new protocols are emerging, data is often compressed and encrypted at the source, and even mobile devices can concurrently manage multiple huge data streams.",N/A,-1,-1

"You can imagine the artificial intelligence engine in a game ramping up the obstacles, or perhaps guidance, as it figures out what a player is actually trying to accomplish at any given time.",N/A,-1,-1
"The researchers looked at five types of data generated during gameplay   action state, action argument, location, narrative state and previously achieved goals   and their system was able to classify with 62.3 percent accuracy what goals a player was trying to achieve.",N/A,-1,-1
"According to their paper, that s a nearly 29 percent improvement over previous approaches.",N/A,-1,-1
"The researchers gathered their data by analyzing the gameplay of 137 eight-graders on Crystal Island, an educational gaming environment developed at NCSU.",Crystal,13,13
"And better yet, while previous approaches required researchers to hand code the features their models needed to analyze, the deep learning approach was able to learn representations of the pertinent features on its own.",N/A,-1,-1
While such a limited study is far from definitive proof that deep learning could revolutionize artificial intelligence in different types of games (many of today s commercial titles are probably much more advanced in terms of the number of possibilities and the number of things going on) it is a good example of the possible applications of deep-learning-based pattern recognition beyond what it s currently known for.,N/A,-1,-1

Apple didn t just deliver one mobile wallet at its iPhone 6 and Apple Watch launch event on Tuesday.,N/A,-1,-1
It delivered two.,N/A,-1,-1
"Its new Apple Pay service, which will launch on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in October, combines two mobile payment methods that are often conflated to represent entirely different types of transactions: using your phone in lieu of plastic to pay at the cash register, and buying goods online over your mobile phone.",N/A,-1,-1
"Apple will bridge the two using a unified wallet that consumers will actually want to use and merchants will actually want to accept, Apple CEO Tim Cook said during his keynote (check out Gigaom s liveblog for all the details from the event).",Cook,27,27
"The problem with previous mobile wallets, Cook said, is that they ve been designed around self-interested business models   for instance, driving dollars into carriers  own wallets, in the case of Isis/Softcard   rather than focused on creating a great consumer experience.",Cook,7,7
"While Apple still has plenty of self-interested reasons to get into the mobile payments game, it definitely appears that Apple Pay is addressing many of the problems plaguing other wallets.",N/A,-1,-1
"And as my colleague Kevin Tofel predicted last week, Apple is integrating Pay with a lot of other services and features readily available and popular on the iPhone and the overall Apple ecosystem.",N/A,-1,-1
"First off, Apple Pay will become part of Passbook, storing your credit cards in tabs the same way it stores your boarding passes and loyalty cards.",N/A,-1,-1
It will use Touch ID to verify consumer identity and presence at the point of sale.,N/A,-1,-1
And it will make use of the 800 million credit cards it already has on file attached to users  Apple IDs.,N/A,-1,-1
"As soon as you activate Apple Pay, you ll already have a credit card loaded: the one you use for your iTunes purchases.",N/A,-1,-1
Apple Pay will also be incorporated directly into the new Apple Watch.,N/A,-1,-1
The new pieces Apple is adding to the puzzle are a near-field communications (NFC) chip and secure hardware element in the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus where credit card information is stored.,N/A,-1,-1
"In that sense, Apple Pay will work very similarly to Isis/Softcard and other contactless wallets.",N/A,-1,-1
The element will store unique virtual credit card numbers different from the digits imprinted on your plastic.,N/A,-1,-1
"After a transaction is complete, the virtual numbers are replaced so your previous transaction data can t be used for fraudulent purchases.",N/A,-1,-1
"That way the merchant never sees your credit card number, security code or even your name, said Eddy Cue, Apple SVP of internet software and services.",N/A,-1,-1
"Apple Pay will work at 220,000 merchant locations in the U.S., including some of the biggest retailers in the country like Walgreens, Macy s, Subway, Whole Foods Market and McDonald s.

"Despite Apple s claim to have cracked the mobile payments code, we could be seeing a showdown brewing between it and some of the country s most powerful retail brands   at least in the smartphone point of sale space.",N/A,-1,-1
"On the m-commerce front, Apple is clearly expanding its online purchasing might beyond iTunes and its various online and app stores into other retail apps and websites.",N/A,-1,-1
PayPal has already been treading this turf since it acquired Braintree.,Braintree,10,10

There are a surprising number of customization options for the Apple Watch.,N/A,-1,-1
"Since looks are so important to watches, Apple Watch will come with a variety of different straps that it is calling bands.",N/A,-1,-1
Apple-made bands will come in three  collections.,N/A,-1,-1
"The Apple Watch Collection is the default band, but there are also sweat-proof  Sport Collection  bands, and Watch Edition bands that will look more like jewelry, some plated with 18-karat gold.",N/A,-1,-1

As the event started to unfold, with Tim Cook walking on stage, the stream switched to a test image:

And when the stream finally caught up with the event, users got to hear a Chinese simulcast translation for the first 30 minutes, leading to more jokes on Twitter:

At some point, people began to wonder: Whose fault is this debacle

Along with two new iPhones and a host of other goodies associated with Tuesday s Apple event was an upgrade of the Apple-designed ARM-based application processor.,N/A,-1,-1
"The latest version, dubbed the A8, is a 64-bit processor with 2 billion transistors   double that of the A7.",N/A,-1,-1
"This is the second 64-bit processor from Apple, which means it can address more memory that higher-end tablets can use to run more programs faster.",N/A,-1,-1
"The new chip uses a 20 nanometer process, which means the lines etched between transistors are smaller and thus you can shove more of them on the chip.",N/A,-1,-1
That means the new CPU is 25 percent faster and has a 50 percent better graphics performance.,N/A,-1,-1
"The game play shown during the event was pretty impressive, almost console quality.",N/A,-1,-1
The smaller process node also makes the chip more energy-efficient.,N/A,-1,-1
"With the larger screens, this may not translate to much in the way of better battery life, but it does mean those speed boosts don t come at a power cost.",N/A,-1,-1
"Because Apple clearly views silicon as a prime differentiator, it also showed a new version of its motion-sensing co-processor, the M8.",N/A,-1,-1
"The new M8 chip can estimate distance and track elevation (such as flights of stairs), and has a barometer sensor.",N/A,-1,-1
This chip is designed to take the weight of calculating data from the accelerometers and gyroscopes off the CPU.,N/A,-1,-1
"In practical terms, it means that the iPhone can count your steps and activities without taking a battery cut from switching the cPU on.",N/A,-1,-1
Co-processors are a hot trend in the chip business and one that Apple helped popularize when it launched the M7 last year on the iPhone 5s.,N/A,-1,-1

"Apple is calling its new display Retina HD, and according to Apple SVP Phil Schiller, the panels sport higher contrast, deeper blacks and wider viewing angles than before.",N/A,-1,-1
"The 4.7-inch iPhone will run at 1334 x 750 resolution, and the 5.5-inch iPhone will run at a 1920 x 1080 resolution.",N/A,-1,-1
This means that the smaller iPhone screen have 326 pixels per inch and the bigger phone will have 401 ppi.,N/A,-1,-1
Older apps will continue to work on the larger iPhones thanks to a  desktop class scaler.,N/A,-1,-1
Both phones have received a complete physical redesign.,N/A,-1,-1
"The new look actually has a little bit of the original iPhone in it, with rounded corners and a smooth aluminum shell.",N/A,-1,-1
"There are two cutout bands on the top and bottom of the back side, and a new, slightly protruding camera near the top.",N/A,-1,-1
"Apple has dropped the circular volume buttons and gone with skinny, pill-shaped buttons that resemble those on the iPhone 5c and iPod touch.",N/A,-1,-1
"Both new devices are thinner than the previous devices: According to Apple, the iPhone 6 is 6.9mm thick, and the iPhone 6 Plus is slightly thicker, at 7.1mm.",N/A,-1,-1
"If you were worried that the bigger screen could introduce ergonomics issues, Apple has added a new  reachability  feature to the iPhone 6 Plus, which is activated by double-tapping the Touch ID button.",N/A,-1,-1
"The iPhone 6 Plus home screen will gain a landscape mode, with dock buttons moving to the right hand side.",N/A,-1,-1
One of the big draws for the new iPhones is shaping up to be battery life.,N/A,-1,-1
"The newest iPhone will have  equal or better battery life in almost every metric than the iPhone 5s,  Schiller said.",N/A,-1,-1
"The iPhone 6 Plus, due to its larger battery, will get more run time than the iPhone 6, but you can expect both to beat the iPhones currently on the market.",N/A,-1,-1
"Both iPhones will be powered by Apple s latest system-on-a-chip, the A8.",N/A,-1,-1
It s a 64-bit chip forged on a 20 nanometer process.,N/A,-1,-1
"Apple promises 25 percent faster CPU performance and 50 percent faster graphics performances, but many of its real-world gains will come from a reduction in power consumption.",N/A,-1,-1
Schiller said the chip is 50 percent more energy efficient.,N/A,-1,-1
"Apple has added a few new components to the A8 SoC, including a new M8 sensor and motion coprocessor, which now comes with a barometer sensor.",N/A,-1,-1
The camera has clearly been a point of emphasis.,N/A,-1,-1
"The new iPhone comes with an 8 megapixel shooter, with a f/2.2 aperture lens.",N/A,-1,-1
"The camera takes advantage of what Apple calls  focus pixels  for phase detection autofocus, which promises autofocus that is twice as fast.",N/A,-1,-1
Panorama mode now can go up to 43 megapixels.,N/A,-1,-1
"The iPhone video camera can now film 1080p at 60 frames per second, and can even film slow-mo up to 240fps.",N/A,-1,-1

"The idea is going beyond our core audience, which has been business, and reaching out to the consumer,  Story said, adding,  The motivation is what would you do now if you wanted to disrupt or wanted to start over with Tableau.",Story,21,21
"He thinks the answer is that you d figure out how to reinvent the product for the tablet market, giving users what he calls a  lean-back experience  (maybe on the couch or an airplane seat) rather than a hunched-over-the-keyboard experience.",N/A,-1,-1
"This way, the thinking goes, a small business owner with a trove of sales data from Square, or an individual consumer with a log of her activity from a fitness-tracking app, can try to make sense of that information in an intuitive way without fighting over the data on one hand and the software on the other.",N/A,-1,-1

"However, while the startups in the space are growing, they lack Tableau s resources and name recognition.",N/A,-1,-1
"They also don t have shareholders, who have already become accustomed to skyrocketing revenues, to please.",N/A,-1,-1
"Those factors put Tableau in a unique position as it tries to expand to a new class of user: It has the tools to build a great product that people should pay attention to, but it also might be a little risk-averse as it tries not to scare public market investors and to ensure its first foray outside its comfort zone isn t a noble failure.",N/A,-1,-1

Companies in search of rapid service provisioning for many concurrent users increasingly adopt the public and private Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) category of cloud services to address their needs.,N/A,-1,-1

"IT personnel often require PaaS technology to manage the complete application life cycle, which includes rapidly building, testing, and delivering services, using an integrated development and scalable hosting environment.",N/A,-1,-1

These benefits are reflected in the considerable growth of PaaS in the past few years in the still emerging public cloud computing space.,N/A,-1,-1
"By one estimate (subscription required) the PaaS market will reach almost $7 billion in 2018, up from $2.5 billion in 2013.",N/A,-1,-1

The biggest question that public cloud providers must answer today is how to deploy PaaS as a major component of their cloud services.,N/A,-1,-1
Cloud providers can take a do-it-yourself approach to PaaS using open-source CloudFoundry and OpenShift or partner with a commercial white label PaaS provider.,N/A,-1,-1

"Additionally, most companies do not have the technical expertise and resources to build or operate open-source PaaS.",N/A,-1,-1
"White label PaaS is a new approach that can help new or existing cloud providers (IaaS and SaaS) catch up with the big three (AWS, Google, and Microsoft) by offering public IaaS and public PaaS under the same brand hosted on their own infrastructure or a third party s.

The second reason  is that Brody has some ideas about how this architecture could change the business models for the internet of things.,N/A,-1,-1

"The E5 v3 family comes stocked with 18 cores per socket, which Bryant said makes for a 50 percent increase over the previous generation s Xeon E5-2600 v2 processors.",Bryant,13,13
"This will also be Intel s first system to ship with DDR4 memory and will result in a 1.4 times increase in workload performance, said Bryant.",Bryant,26,26
"With telemetry sensors and thermal sensors built into the new processors, users can run firmware that will be able to monitor the performance levels of their data center in regards to airflow, CPU and memory utilization, temperature and other metrics.",N/A,-1,-1
"Being able to monitor performance will help users understand when resources are oversubscribed, which can result in lower application performance, said Bryant.",Bryant,23,23

"Thanks to the popularity of its FireChat hyperlocal messaging app, Open Garden s networking software has been downloaded into more than 5 million mobile devices around the world.",N/A,-1,-1
Open Garden believes it now has enough users out there to execute the next the stage of its plan: it wants to use all of these smartphone nodes to create a new network for the internet of things.,N/A,-1,-1
This concept probably requires some explaining as it doesn t fit into any of the other IoT networking schemes we ve written about in the past.,N/A,-1,-1
"Unlike say your smart home, which uses a hub to aggregate a bunch of Zigbee or Wi-Fi connections, or a connected vehicle fleet, which taps into the cellular network, Open Garden s IoT network would be created through millions of shared connections owned by you, me or anyone else with one of its apps on their smartphones, tablets or PCs.",N/A,-1,-1
Open Garden s apps all have one thing in common: they create networks on the fly from the connections all around us.,N/A,-1,-1
"These kind of ad hoc networks will connect nearby smartphones and tablets, each of which will act as node that can either receive data or pass it along.",N/A,-1,-1
Open Garden s apps then use these networks for different things.,N/A,-1,-1
"In the case of FireChat, those ad hoc Bluetooth or Wi-Fi networks let nearby users communicate without an internet connection, passing their conversations through a chain of intermeshed smartphones.",N/A,-1,-1
"In the case of its bandwidth-sharing app, devices within the same mesh network can borrow each other s internet connections.",N/A,-1,-1
"The underlying ad hoc networking technology is the same though the applications themselves are different, said Christophe Daligault, Open Garden VP of marketing and sales.",N/A,-1,-1
"That means there is plenty of opportunity to hang more apps and devices on Open Garden s network, and it s starting at the CTIA Wireless conference in Las Vegas, where it announced a partnership with smart tag maker TrackR.",Las Vegas,29,30
TrackR s Bluetooth-enabled tracking tags already use ad hoc networking to help you find your lost items.,N/A,-1,-1
"If you report an item lost, its tag will start reaching out to other TrackR users via their smartphone apps.",N/A,-1,-1
"If the network detects a lost tag it will report its location to its rightful owner, dropping a pin on a map.",N/A,-1,-1
What Open Garden is doing is greatly expanding the scope of that locator network by allowing TrackR tags to communicate with every smartphone with the FireChat or Open Garden app.,N/A,-1,-1
Basically TrackR is putting millions more phones on the lookout for its customers  lost goods.,N/A,-1,-1
It all happens in the background so users FireChat aren t interrupting their own smartphone activities to hunt for a lost set of keys or misplaced bag.,N/A,-1,-1
"And that s just one of many possible apps that could make use of the network, Daligault said.",N/A,-1,-1
"Instead of relying on Wi-Fi or cellular, sensor networks could rely on ad hoc networks to intermittently upload your data.",N/A,-1,-1
"When an Open Garden-enabled smartphone wanders by it uploads its data via a Bluetooth Low Energy Radio, using the smartphone s 3G or 4G connection as bridge to the cloud.",Energy,15,15
"Many of the devices of the internet of things have Bluetooth and Wi-Fi radios, but don t sport cellular connections.",Many,0,0
They could all use an ad hoc network for that final hop to the internet.,N/A,-1,-1
"Though TrackR isn t opting to do so, any developer could incorporate Open Garden s connection-sharing technology into its smartphone apps, which essentially make them nodes on the growing ad hoc network.",N/A,-1,-1
"The more nodes on the network, the more chance any given device can form a connection, and the more benefit accrues to every service and user on the network   even if each individual user is only using one of the possible applications.",N/A,-1,-1
"Of course, this kind of shared networking comes with controversy.",N/A,-1,-1
It s one thing for Open Garden to ask its customers to participate directly in a shared messaging network like FireChat.,N/A,-1,-1
It s another thing to ask them to use their phones as way-stations for other traffic they have no interest in and control over.,N/A,-1,-1
"Though the TrackR device connecting to your FireChat phone is only sending the minutest amount of data over its cellular connection, it s still using your data plan all the same.",N/A,-1,-1
"Open Garden, however, has been emphasizing from is foundation that these kinds of trade-offs will be necessary if we re to build an internet where all things are connected efficiently and cheaply at all times.",N/A,-1,-1
"While the person or device next to you may be using your internet connection to transfer his data one day, your device or tablet might be using his radio the next.",N/A,-1,-1
"And though Open Garden claims its network is secure, keeping transient data isolated from the data on its devices, any time one device connects to another, the risk of security breach always increases.",N/A,-1,-1
"The new TrackR features will be enabled in Open Garden s next update to its messaging and internet sharing apps, and Daligault said the company would make it very clear in its new terms of service that this kind of ad hoc networking will be going on in the background.",N/A,-1,-1
"As for future apps beyond TrackR, Open Garden will put restrictions on just how much data any device or app can use in order to prevent its users  data plans from being drained.",N/A,-1,-1

"So far, Embr Labs has pitched Wristify, the prototype bracelet, as a standalone device that heats or cools you so you don t have to futz with the room thermostat as much.",N/A,-1,-1
If that works as advertised it would save on both heating/cooling costs and the aggravation caused by temperature-setting spats with family and friends.,N/A,-1,-1
"But longer term, the startup s co-founders want to connect that device to your car, your office or your home to open up a real-time temperature feedback loop.",N/A,-1,-1
Say you re leaving your office and it s freezing out; your device could apply heat to your wrists and beam your thermal signature ahead to the awaiting car.,N/A,-1,-1
A connected car would thus sense that you re chilly and may need some more heat than normal.,N/A,-1,-1
"We want to put Blue Tooth and Wi-Fi into our chip so it can send your temperature preferences not just to your car but to your home and office too,  said Sam Shames, an undergraduate in MIT s Materials Science and Engineering program and an Embr Labs co-founder.",N/A,-1,-1
"If you can adjust your own temperature one degree, you can get more comfortable and also save 100 times the amount of energy that Wristify uses,  he said.",N/A,-1,-1
"The idea is that Wristify can take the edge off discomfort by applying pulses of coolness or warmth to your wrist, which makes your whole body seem cooler or warmer.",N/A,-1,-1
It s sort of the same principle as splashing your wrists with cold water on hot days.,N/A,-1,-1
"Don t laugh, it helps.",N/A,-1,-1
The benefit is that cooling or warming yourself is much more energy-efficient than cooling or warming up an entire room.,N/A,-1,-1
And the individualized nature of it means everyone can walk around in what Embr calls their own personal  thermal comfort zones.,N/A,-1,-1
Shames pitched Wristify Saturday at the MIT Global Founders Skills Accelerator Demo day.,N/A,-1,-1
The startup hopes to broaden field trials for the project this fall and to launch a crowd funding campaign next year.,N/A,-1,-1
The notion of smart wearable devices that talk to each other will be a key theme at the Structure Connect conference next month.,N/A,-1,-1
"Basically, Wristify is a Peltier cooler which ExtremeTech explained much better than I could:

Thermoelectric cooling is governed by the Peltier effect, which describes heating or cooling caused by electric current flowing across a junction of two different conductors.",N/A,-1,-1

"If you have a series of these junctions, and put a heatsink on the hot side, you can create a very effective heat pump.",N/A,-1,-1
"There are potentially other, perhaps more frivolous but also more entertaining applications for Wristify.",N/A,-1,-1

Verizon is testing a car sharing app service called Verizon Auto Share that will let users search for the nearest available car in the program and then let them reserve it and use their phones to unlock and start the car.,N/A,-1,-1
The program will be available at the end of 2014.,N/A,-1,-1
"It s very similar to car2go, a service owned by Daimler that does the same thing.",N/A,-1,-1
"But as cool as it would be to ditch your car and then rely on the serendipity of having a vehicle nearby work at the touch of your phone, why is Verizon getting into this market  My bet is that the carrier recognizes that control of the overall experience will matter when it comes to connected devices and that it can charge a premium because it will have access to the cloud, the network (on the car s side) and the app.",N/A,-1,-1
In some cases it will have control of the handset as well.,N/A,-1,-1
This allows Verizon to guarantee levels of service and reliability that others may not be able to do and also allows Verizon to take a cut of the revenue by providing the service as opposed to merely the networking side of it.,N/A,-1,-1

"Instead of being bitter, Gross says he s just happy that something he thought of eventually reached the market and changed the world:

Since GoTo/Overture, the venture fund/incubator that Gross runs   called Idealab   has launched more than 100 different companies, most of which have either gone public or been acquired, including names such as CitySearch, eToys.com and UberMedia, a venture that was initially aimed at building a media company based on Twitter.",N/A,-1,-1
"But the entrepreneur says he still has far too many ideas than he can work on, so he has been trying to think of ways to give them away.",N/A,-1,-1
"At first, Gross says he tried to put lists of startup ideas on the Idealab website, but his lawyers were worried about future intellectual property or trademark issues, and advised against it.",N/A,-1,-1
"So he came up with Idea Day, which took place earlier this year and involved 100 entrepreneurs coming together to choose from a list of 10 ideas   the event produced almost 50 worthwhile entries, he says, of which Idealab chose four, and three of those have gone on to raise outside funding.",N/A,-1,-1

"Even at their smallest they re still big, bulky, and have limited life spans.",N/A,-1,-1

"Dozens of studies have come out in the past two or three years showing progress across all categories, but aside from a few outliers (i.e.",N/A,-1,-1

"Tom Emrich, an expert on wearables and cofounder of Wearable App Review, said that while patients in a medical setting are likely to be more open to harvesting energy from ambient sources like their own bodies because the doctor prescribed it and their health is at stake, it will likely take a few years for consumers to warm to alternative power sources when recharging batteries currently works for our first-gen wearables.",N/A,-1,-1
"As wearables become more the clothing and accessories we wear, I think energy harvesting will be huge and will be a major value proposition for why we wear our devices,  he told me.",N/A,-1,-1

"But Yogesh Ramadass, who has been working on ambient energy harvesting since he was a student at MIT and now as a lead design engineer at Texas Instruments, told me it s important to separate out non-critical applications like monitoring one s heart rate and body temp from life critical ones, like Pacemakers.",Texas,27,27
"Given the implications involved if the ambient energy fails in something like a Pacemaker, he said, it could be many years before we are confident enough to rely on ambient energy to power the more critical medical devices without back-up batteries.",N/A,-1,-1
"In the meantime, a hybrid system   part harvesting, part back-up battery   will probably be the bridge, much in the way EV hybrids like the Chevy Volt help people conquer their fears of range anxiety.",N/A,-1,-1
"Those systems are possible, where 90 percent of the time you are harvesting, but 10 percent of the time to offer peace of mind or get through regulatory hurdles you d still put in a small battery to back it up,  Ramadass said.",N/A,-1,-1

But Meagher points out the flaw in welcoming all of the current devices on the market today.,N/A,-1,-1
"What s happening right now is some APIs are being opened, not all, and the only way you can actually control the device or integrate it into your ecosystem is by actually going through the cloud-to-cloud,  Meagher said.",N/A,-1,-1
"So for example, whatever the device is, is talking to the manufacturer or the vendor s cloud platform and then they are allowing you access to their cloud s data   but if I am responsible to you with a level of service for your home so when you push a button you want your air conditioning to go on or off I m dependent on a third party that won t give me any guarantee of service   they won t give you any guarantee of service, so how is that going to work.",N/A,-1,-1
"How is that going to scale  

One reason he s concerned about this is that Lowe s charges a $9.99 monthly subscription fee for its connected-home service, but it s doing so because it wants not only to support the backend costs of offering a platform, but also because it is trying to reach a mainstream consumer who wants one person to call when his or her lights don t work properly with a doorbell made by a different manufacturer.",N/A,-1,-1

The iPhone 4S originally shipped with iOS 5 in 2011 and the iPhone 5 originally shipped with iOS 6 in 2012.,N/A,-1,-1
"So depending on when Apple decides to officially launch iOS 8, the time you have left to update to iOS 7 is quickly coming to a close.",N/A,-1,-1
"Archive your downloaded apps: If you do intend to keep running iOS 7 (or even iOS 6) on your device for a while longer, you may want to consider archiving your iTunes App Store purchases.",N/A,-1,-1

"Using the latest version of iTunes, create a new iTunes Library by holding down the option key on Mac or the shift key on Microsoft Windows when launching.",N/A,-1,-1
Then log into the iTunes Store and download all prior app purchases.,N/A,-1,-1
"Once completed, you will have an iTunes Library that you can keep separate from your main iTunes Library, with a  snapshot  of all of the currently working versions of apps you have purchased for your device.",N/A,-1,-1
This tactic will only help in situations related to compatibility on the device directly and will not necessarily work when app developers make changes in the cloud.,N/A,-1,-1

Manage iCloud backups: During the upgrade process you may be prompted to restore from a recent backup.,N/A,-1,-1
That s also the path you ll be likely to take when you transfer your apps and data from an old device to a new one.,N/A,-1,-1
The amount of time it takes to restore from an iCloud backup depends partly on the speed of your network and partly on the size of your backup.,N/A,-1,-1

Offload your photos: One of the biggest space hogs on any iOS device is the Photo Album.,N/A,-1,-1
Offloading your photos to a PC or Mac can make restoring from a backup or transitioning to a new device faster and easier.,N/A,-1,-1
The easiest way to offload photos from your iOS device is to use the OS X Image Capture app on your Mac or Photo Gallery on PC.,N/A,-1,-1

Switching carriers when buying a new iPhone might be something to consider.,N/A,-1,-1

Zapier Co-founder Bryan Helmig came on the Structure Show podcast this week to discuss how the company did it and what types of interactions they enable.,Bryan,2,2
It s an entertaining interview and also informative.,N/A,-1,-1

"Sure, there were other notable moments during that period (and plenty before then) but those were the events that truly made people realize how Apple was defining the current generation of personal computing.",N/A,-1,-1
Tuesday s event will be one of those crossroads events: one that we ll remember either as a day Apple articulated a new vision for computing that we ve been waiting for someone to advance   or as a sign it has overreached.,N/A,-1,-1
"It looks as if the new product category that Apple watchers have been clamoring for since Tim Cook became CEO in 2011 is here, in the form of what we ll call the iWatch.",Cook,17,17
"We don t know what it looks like or exactly how it will work, but we know that it will pair with the iPhone and we know that it will serve as a landmark product for those who have wondered if Apple could sustain its amazing run of innovation as we approach the third anniversary of Jobs  death.",N/A,-1,-1
"How can I be so sure  One of the many interesting tidbits from 9to5Mac s recent report on Apple s PR strategy was how the company sought to manage expectations in the weeks leading up to previous events, usually attempting to downplay the often silly anticipation that Apple was about to blow everybody s minds the same way it did in January 2007.",N/A,-1,-1
"Over the past few weeks, Apple has done almost the opposite with this event:

 This event is uncharted territory,  said no less an Apple authority than Daring Fireball s John Gruber this week.",N/A,-1,-1

Apple edged in that direction with the original iPhone, but the design breakthrough then was really more about user experience than it was true fashion.",N/A,-1,-1

"From scientist social network ResearchGate to healthcare social network Doximity, the eight or more vertical professional networks that have emerged over the past decade have raised over half a billion in venture funding.",N/A,-1,-1
The latest one to try to break into the market is Chef s Roll; it s a LinkedIn for chefs.,N/A,-1,-1
It launched in October 2013 to try to make it easier for chefs to search for jobs and for hospitality companies to find them.,N/A,-1,-1
"The profiles offer features helpful for those in the food industry, such an emphasis on visual content like food porn photos and videos of the chefs at work.",N/A,-1,-1
"Before starting Chef s Roll, company co-founder and CEO Thomas Keslinke gained 14 years of experience in hospitality, restaurant, and catering management.",Thomas,10,10
"LinkedIn falls short on giving the creative industries the ability to showcase their talents,  he told me.",N/A,-1,-1
Keslinke and his co-founder have bootstrapped the company on a freemium selling plan but tell me they re now shopping for investors.,N/A,-1,-1
"It may be a struggle for the duo, unless they can prove that the market of chef recruiters   and the companies who want to sell equipment to chefs   are both sizeable enough to generate venture-backed returns.",N/A,-1,-1
"Before you giggle and immediately dismiss the idea of LinkedIn for chefs, it s worth noting that Chef s Roll is following a trend set by some pretty big startups.",N/A,-1,-1
"Although you might think that specialized LinkedIns wouldn t attract big enough audiences for venture bets, that hasn t been the case.",N/A,-1,-1
"One of the oldest and biggest players is Spiceworks, a social network for IT professionals.",N/A,-1,-1

Institutions looking to hire such employees are happy to cough up the recruiting fee to post open jobs.,N/A,-1,-1
"In these industries, these targeted LinkedIns are money-makers.",N/A,-1,-1
But will that be the case with Chef s Roll  The website is early enough in its history that it hasn t penetrated much of the market.,N/A,-1,-1
"Keslinke told me they only have 3,600 users, and are aiming for a market of  10 million  worldwide.",N/A,-1,-1
"He envisions a future much like the experience of Doximity and Spiceworks, where culinary equipment companies pay to advertise to the curated audience of chefs, or where hospitality brands cough up the big bucks for recruiting.",N/A,-1,-1

"First and foremost, such a company should provide a key service to its users, such that they flock in droves.",N/A,-1,-1
ResearchGate does that by providing an easy feature for scientists across the world to collaborate on research.,N/A,-1,-1
Spiceworks does it by offering a free network management tool to IT pros.,N/A,-1,-1
Both have reached huge chunks of their target markets.,N/A,-1,-1

"If it builds its own power around the factory, will it overcome the variable nature of solar and wind using its own batteries for energy storage, storing the energy during the day to be used at night or when the wind dies down  Tesla would need some kind of way to overcome the solar and wind fluctuations, whether that s the grid, generators, or energy storage.",N/A,-1,-1

"However, Tesla might also be buying geothermal power from sites that are already under development and drilled.",N/A,-1,-1
"Since Tesla said the factory will be  net energy zero,  the company might end up buying renewable energy credits (RECs) to cover any clean power that it can t buy or generate itself.",N/A,-1,-1
"All of these energy details will need to be worked out pretty soon, as clean energy power plants can take many months and even years to build, and Tesla wants its battery factory delivering batteries by 2017, with the ability to produce enough batteries to power 500,000 cars by 2020.",N/A,-1,-1

Motorola says the Turbo Charger is coming soon and will cost $34.99 when it goes on sale.,N/A,-1,-1
"When using it with devices that don t support Qualcomm s technology, it will provide a full 15 Watt charge.",N/A,-1,-1
"The obvious downside here is that you ll need to tote the Turbo Charger to get the battery benefit, but I think that   and $35   is a small price to pay for an extra 8 hours of run-time in just a 15-minute span of time.",N/A,-1,-1
"As baby boomers (and now Generation Xers) get older and grayer, the market for technology to monitor their health and help them age at home, rather than in some institution, is a potential gold mine.",N/A,-1,-1
And that is not lost on vendors wanting a piece of the action.,N/A,-1,-1
"The big conundrum for these vendors is providing technology that is drop-dead simple to use   i.e doesn t need a ton of charging, resetting, and other futzing   and doesn t feel stalker-ish.",N/A,-1,-1
"No one wants to feel as if she s under surveillance in her own home, but the point of these devices   smartphones, smartwatches, in-home sensors   is, in fact, to watch the senior citizen, albeit with the best of intentions.",N/A,-1,-1
"First, the obligatory stat: Worldwide revenue generated by home healthcare devices and associated services will soar to $12.6 billion in 2018, up 121 percent from $5.7 billion in 2013, according to numbers released by market researcher IHS in May.",N/A,-1,-1
"IHS segments the overall market into six buckets   independent living services, consumer medical devices, telehealth, personal emergency response systems (PERS), wearable technologies and health gaming.",N/A,-1,-1
There was a flurry of product release news on tech-for-seniors front this week.,N/A,-1,-1
"First, Lively previewed its new wearable PERS device in the form of a watch that combines a (big) button to reach emergency services, a pedometer and a medication reminder.",N/A,-1,-1
It also includes  passivity sensors  to detect whether a senior s activity is reduced and alert designated family or friends when thresholds for activity are not met.,N/A,-1,-1
"And because many older seniors may not have Wi-Fi in their homes, it relies on cellular service along with an in-home hub so that the device works within 1,000 feet of the base.",N/A,-1,-1
"The watch, pictured below, can also be paired with a smartphone to operate when the user is out and about.",N/A,-1,-1
"The unit costs $49.95, with service coming in at another $34.95 per month.",N/A,-1,-1
"Forrester Research senior analyst Julie Ask said one key to success in this market is making the technology so easy that it disappears into the woodwork   it needs super-long-life batteries, and a very easy and legible UI, both of which Lively has thought out.",N/A,-1,-1
Big buttons are key for a population with vision problems and a watch is something that many in this demographic already use so the form factor won t be jarring.,N/A,-1,-1
"The idea that a wearable device would note when its wearer has gone from 4,000 steps a day to 1,000 or less and ping a distant family member is pretty appealing.",N/A,-1,-1
The AARP and Intel announced a new Atom-based Android tablet targeting the 70 million Americans over 50.,N/A,-1,-1
The RealPad aims to make it easier for non-tech-savvy seniors to initiate video calls with their families and other tasks.,N/A,-1,-1
"The $189 device, which runs Android KitKat, comes with bundled support and an Intel-built RealQuickFix dashboard to show battery life, Wi-Fi connectivity and Bluetooth status as well as easy fixes for common problems.",N/A,-1,-1
"GreenPeak Technologies, a company out of Utrecht, the Netherlands, has launched Senior Lifestyles, which pairs a home network of Zigbee sensors with a cloud-based data aggregation point that lets families share status data securely over popular social networking apps.",N/A,-1,-1
"If, for example, your grandfather is not detected moving around the apartment for eight hours, a message would go out to family or designated friends via Facebook, WhatsApp, WeChat or QQ, according to the company.",N/A,-1,-1
The internet of things means that more homes will be connected and monitored by your device of choice and that will be a big theme at Structure Connect next month in San Francisco.,San Francisco,31,32
"Finally, GreatCall, the company behind the popular big-button Jitterbug phone for seniors, this week launched its new Touch3 smartphone, which can come bundled with access to agents who use the phone s location data and the user s personal profile information to assess status in an emergency and send help.",N/A,-1,-1
There is also 24-7 access to speak with registered nurses or doctors without a co-payment.,N/A,-1,-1
Touch3 phones are $169.99 for the device alone.,N/A,-1,-1
"No contract is required but monthly service options including the aforementioned agent and medical services start at $24.99 per month, with data plans starting at $2.49 per month for 20 MB.",N/A,-1,-1
"The Samsung Galaxy phone also offers the MedCoach medication reminder app and a Link app for family caregivers, who can download it to their smartphones, access information in urgent situations and receive snapshots of daily activities.",N/A,-1,-1
"It s good that these companies are researching the needs of this rapidly growing population, but there are a couple of caveats.",N/A,-1,-1
"First, it seems that some of these vendors (I m looking at you, AARP and Intel!",N/A,-1,-1
) lump all seniors into one humongous  over 50  block.,N/A,-1,-1
That is a mistake.,N/A,-1,-1
"There s a huge difference between 50- and 60-somethings, and older seniors in their eighties and nineties.",N/A,-1,-1
That population is much less likely to be device-savvy and more likely to have vision and hearing impairments.,N/A,-1,-1
"For them, a whole other class of technology is needed   big-buttoned watches and smartphones might be of use, or perhaps a home sensor network connected to loved ones.",N/A,-1,-1
Aging in place is a killer application area for the internet of things.,N/A,-1,-1
"If you or your grandmother can control her lights and coffee maker from a smartphone or easy to use tablet, that s great.",N/A,-1,-1
It s even better if you can be discreetly apprised of her level of activity and alerted if she doesn t take her pills on time.,N/A,-1,-1
The dark side of that is making sure that only you or other authorized people are on the receiving end of that data.,N/A,-1,-1
"Seniors living alone with devices silently beaming out information about what they re doing and when, about their mobility and state of health, also means big-time security issues.",N/A,-1,-1
"As we know very well by now, claiming something is secure is easy, but ensuring that it is so, is not.",N/A,-1,-1
"So I m bullish on devices like the Lively Watch, which is a pretty unobtrusive device that provides a discrete flow of important data to authorized care givers.",N/A,-1,-1
It seems like the sort of thing a senior might actually wear and forget about.,N/A,-1,-1
It sure beats installing webcams around the house.,N/A,-1,-1
But vigilance on the security side is essential.,N/A,-1,-1
"Last week, I was out with my family at an outdoor shopping center.",N/A,-1,-1
"As we walked from one set of retail stores to another, my iPhone buzzed and there on my lockscreen was a notification showing my Starbucks Card.",N/A,-1,-1
I wasn t in a Starbucks but instead was within sight of one I d visited previously.,N/A,-1,-1
Next week at an Apple press event   we ll be there with a live-blog on Tuesday   we re very likely to hear that Apple has cracked the mobile wallet challenge where so many others in the U.S. have failed.,N/A,-1,-1
"And that pop-up notification from my Starbucks Card, which is also in my Apple Passbook app, got me thinking of how Apple may succeed in the wireless payment space with all of the right moving parts in place at just the right time.",N/A,-1,-1
It could even benefit the expected iWatch launch.,N/A,-1,-1
Let s start with the basics: A method to use the iPhone in place of physical credit card.,N/A,-1,-1
All signs point to a near-field communications (NFC) chip in the next iPhone and I have little reason to doubt that.,N/A,-1,-1
"Last week, I offered two reasons that NFC in the iPhone 6 makes sense both for payments and for simple pairing of Bluetooth accessories, such as a wearable device.",N/A,-1,-1
"For many mainstream consumers, this would be new technology but of course, it s been around for several years.",N/A,-1,-1
"That doesn t matter to the people who ve never used NFC in either instance; it will be a desirable, new experience.",N/A,-1,-1
There s a problem though.,N/A,-1,-1
"If only the new iPhone   or iPhones, assuming two size options   have an NFC chip, how will the tens of millions of current iPhone owners be part of this new mobile payment revolution  Sure, folks can upgrade but not everyone who owns an iPhone will do so.",N/A,-1,-1
"Enter the iWatch, or whatever Apple decides to call its wearable device.",N/A,-1,-1
I d expect the iWatch to also have NFC and not just for simple pairing to an iPhone over Bluetooth 4.0; the device could also possibly be part of the authentication process for payments since older phones don t have Touch ID.,N/A,-1,-1
"If so, you could use the iWatch in lieu of an iPhone to pay for items in retail stores.",N/A,-1,-1
"Since the wearable device connects to an iPhone, the wallet application could work with the accessory.",N/A,-1,-1
"And guess what: Every iPhone that Apple currently sells   the iPhone 4s, 5c and 5s   supports Bluetooth 4.0, which could link NFC on the wrist and a wallet app on the phone.",N/A,-1,-1
This not only brings a wider audience to Apple s wireless payment implementation but also gives more people incentive to buy the iWatch: A double-win for Apple.,N/A,-1,-1
Going back to my Starbucks  out of store  experience   it actually did get me to go in and buy an espresso   adds another potential twist to Apple s wallet aspirations: iBeacon.,N/A,-1,-1
We haven t heard much of late about the small Bluetooth devices that can pinpoint your indoor location.,N/A,-1,-1
These launched with iOS 7 last year and some retailers have added them in the past 12 months.,N/A,-1,-1
The reason my iPhone surfaced my Starbucks Card last week was because it detected I was near the coffee shop.,N/A,-1,-1
"It can do this with GPS, Wi-Fi or both and it s pretty handy.",N/A,-1,-1
"Apple can take things a step further, though, with iBeacon.",N/A,-1,-1
Perhaps the wallet app or Passbook pops up a coupon or other promotion when iBeacons recognize I m actually just outside or in a store.,N/A,-1,-1
"Better yet, since iBeacons can pinpoint indoor proximity to a more precise level, my iPhone could realize when I m in the checkout line of a store.",N/A,-1,-1
The wallet app or store card for that particular location could magically surface just the right card so I don t have to fumble around with a dozen piece of plastic in my physical wallet.,N/A,-1,-1
"Think of it as a contextual experience when paying: The right time, place and card.",N/A,-1,-1
"None of this is possible without the right backing, however.",N/A,-1,-1
And it speaks volumes to why Google Wallet and the carrier payment systems   first dubbed Isis and now called Softcard   have generally been a bust.,N/A,-1,-1
"Simply put, neither have the clout that Apple has in two regards.",N/A,-1,-1
"First, carriers have little control over Apple, or put another way: Carriers have more control over Google than they do over Apple.",N/A,-1,-1
"The U.S. network providers, for example, had little incentive to push Google Wallet when they had their own wireless payment program.",N/A,-1,-1
That s partly why Verizon Wireless customers couldn t use Google Wallet with NFC or tap-to-pay services: The carrier had the power to keep Google Wallet off of phones that ran on Verizon s network.,N/A,-1,-1
"And unlike Apple s global aspirations, Google doesn t even support the Wallet app on phones purchased outside of the U.S.",N/A,-1,-1
"While it clearly has relationships with them through its Wallet app, Google likely doesn t have the same influence over banks that Apple has either; not with Apple s estimated 800 million iTunes accounts.",N/A,-1,-1
"So it wouldn t be able to work favorable deals with Master Card, Visa, Discover and American Express.",N/A,-1,-1
It s been reported that Apple has been in discussion at least three of those four card providers and was able to cut deals directly with bank-card issuers; possibly getting lower transaction fees as a result.,N/A,-1,-1
And that s just like Apple: It will use its considerable clout to cut in on an industry and create a new revenue stream.,N/A,-1,-1
How might this all create more revenue for Apple  I m not yet sure but have at least one idea.,N/A,-1,-1
"If Apple has negotiated lower rates on payment transactions, it could allow for customers to simply charge physical retail items through their iTunes account.",N/A,-1,-1
"With the savings on transaction processing, Apple could offer incentives for shopping in the iTunes Store.",N/A,-1,-1
"Charge your groceries to your Master Card through the iPhone, for example, and get a few dollars off the next time you buy something from iTunes.",N/A,-1,-1
That would bring more customers to Apple s store and perhaps get them to spend more.,N/A,-1,-1
Perhaps that s too complex of a solution though and Apple simply gets a small cut of every transaction charged through an iPhone or iWatch.,N/A,-1,-1
"That s how Apple makes its money now from the sale of music, video and apps and is the more likely scenario.",N/A,-1,-1
"Regardless of how this all pans out next week, it s clear to me that out of everyone in the mobile industry, only Apple currently has all of the pieces of the mobile payment puzzle for a chance of success.",N/A,-1,-1
"It s not just the clout of Apple, the devices, and the software to pull this off.",N/A,-1,-1
It s the combination and control of these things that no other company can currently offer.,N/A,-1,-1
"After the Moto 360 went on sale earlier today, consumers who want a little bit of Android on their wrist will have at least six different options.",N/A,-1,-1
"Even though Android Wear may not be a must-have yet, the platform still offers a lot for people who are heavily plugged into Google s ecosystem.",N/A,-1,-1
"Although Google has designed Android Wear to work the same on most devices, there s still a surprising amount of cosmetic and functional differences between the models.",N/A,-1,-1
Make sure you get the right one for you.,N/A,-1,-1
"Look: At a glance, the Samsung Gear Live looks like any of the other eight smartwatches Samsung has pushed to market this year.",N/A,-1,-1
"As for its feel   A little bulky, but feels good on the wrist.",N/A,-1,-1
You get a choice of black or magenta-hued red watch bands.,N/A,-1,-1
Pros: Samsung s AMOLED screens look great even at these smaller sizes.,N/A,-1,-1
"As one of the original two Android Wear devices, if you had one of these a few months ago you were on the absolute cutting edge.",N/A,-1,-1
Cons: Its snap-on charging mechanism has been called horrible and is breaking for a lot of people.,N/A,-1,-1
"Samsung doesn t feel totally committed to Android Wear, due to its competing line of Tizen-based smartwatches.",N/A,-1,-1
Look (w/colors): Boxy.,N/A,-1,-1
"Like someone at LG shrunk a phone, but couldn t keep shrinking it any farther, then added a strap.",N/A,-1,-1
Comes in gold and black.,N/A,-1,-1
Pros: Is considered to be the original Android Wear reference device.,N/A,-1,-1
"As the first of its kind, will make a wonderful piece of computing history one day.",N/A,-1,-1
Cons: It comes with a cheap-feeling charging cradle that doesn t do wireless.,N/A,-1,-1
The terminal pins on the back for charging may corrode and irritate your skin.,N/A,-1,-1
No heart rate monitor.,N/A,-1,-1
Look: Like a military-style field watch.,N/A,-1,-1
Round face.,N/A,-1,-1
Wide bezel.,N/A,-1,-1
Lugs.,N/A,-1,-1
"A crown, which not only completes the watch look but adds a useful button.",N/A,-1,-1
"Pros: If you want an Android Wear device that nobody will notice is actually a smartwatch, this is probably your best bet.",N/A,-1,-1
Cons: Comes in any color you like as long as it s black.,N/A,-1,-1
Its aggressive masculine style might not fit in with some wardrobes.,N/A,-1,-1
"Can you really wait until October 

Look: With an elongated, rounded yet vaguely rectangular face, the Zenwatch looks like a river pebble that s been smoothed on a river bed for years, then had a slightly curved screen installed.",N/A,-1,-1
The finishing touch is rose-gold trim around the edge.,N/A,-1,-1
Pros: Machined aluminum body sounds premium.,N/A,-1,-1
Comes with a  genuine stitched-leather strap  out of the box.,N/A,-1,-1
"Asus has added a little bit of its own software as well, which allows the ZenWatch to unlock a Bluetooth-connected phone.",N/A,-1,-1
Cons: Watch strap only comes in brown.,N/A,-1,-1
IP55 waterproof rating is a disappointment compared to other Android Wear watches with IP68 certification.,N/A,-1,-1
"Price:  199, which will likely be $199 when it hits American shores.",Price,0,0
Look: Metal and premium.,N/A,-1,-1
"There will be a black version and a silver version, and the black face with metal bezel looks a lot like a classic Braun watch.",N/A,-1,-1
Probably the only current Android Wear watch that Dieter Rams would wear.,N/A,-1,-1
Comes with either a chain-link steel or a leather band.,N/A,-1,-1
"Pros: As my colleague Kevin Tofel said after he saw one in-person at Google I/O,  the Moto 360 screams premium based on fit and finish.",N/A,-1,-1
Moto 360 is also the only Android Wear smartwatch so far that charges wirelessly.,N/A,-1,-1
"Cons: Despite the fact the Moto 360 is billed as a circular smartwatch, it s not fully circular.",N/A,-1,-1
"There s a small cutout on the bottom of the screen that doesn t display any information, which is bogus and may require apps to be optimized for its unique display.",N/A,-1,-1
Call it the Moto 270.,N/A,-1,-1
It s also more expensive than your other options.,N/A,-1,-1
"Availability: Motorola, Google Play and Best Buy coming soon.",N/A,-1,-1
Look: Classic Sony.,N/A,-1,-1
Black base color with metallic accents.,N/A,-1,-1
"The watch face blends into the strap, but the required rubber wrist bands make it look less like a distinguished timepiece and more like a child s watch.",N/A,-1,-1
"Cons: You re restricted to using Sony s built-in rubber wristbands, which come in a variety of neon colors and have an announced cost of  25.",N/A,-1,-1
You can t swap in your favorite watch strap.,N/A,-1,-1
"Instead of a charging cradle, there s a fiddly micro USB port on the underside.",N/A,-1,-1
Four big tech companies embroiled in a Silicon Valley hiring controversy are appealing a judge s decision to reject a settlement that would have seen them pay $325 million to settle a class action case brought engineers and other employees.,Valley,8,8
"According to Reuters, the companies   Apple, Google, Adobe and Intel   have described  U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh s decision last month as  rigid and formulaic  and suggested that rejecting the deal would serve to waste years of court time.",N/A,-1,-1
"The underlying controversy turns on an alleged conspiracy by some of the tech world s biggest names, including the late Steve Jobs of Apple and Sergey Brin of Google, in which their companies agreed not to recruit each others  employees.",N/A,-1,-1
"The employees sued to recover wages lost as a result of the conspiracy, leading to the proposed settlement earlier this year.",N/A,-1,-1
"Ordinarily, courts are quick to approve such deals but Judge Koh decided to reject it as too low in light of a similar settlement involving Pixar, Lucas Films and Intuit.",Lucas,28,28
"Based on that earlier settlement, Koh said, Apple and the three other companies should offer at least $380 million.",N/A,-1,-1
The decision by the four companies to file the appeal may in part amount to a negotiating tactic.,N/A,-1,-1
The parties have already resumed negotiations and the prospect of years of appellate court litigation could spur the employees to accept a new offer.,N/A,-1,-1
"If you re eager to experience virtual reality but don t want to wait for Facebook s Oculus Rift, you will be able to get a head start with the Samsung Gear VR headset that will be released this fall.",N/A,-1,-1
Oculus was a major partner in the device s creation and will be among the companies involved in the first wave of applications that will go live.,N/A,-1,-1
"It turns out that cinematic virtual reality will be one of the easiest experiences to adapt to a mobile phone, and companies building movie viewing platforms for Oculus are jumping on board.",N/A,-1,-1
"Jaunt, a Palo Alto startup that makes software and 360 degree cameras for creating virtual reality films, is preparing an application for Gear VR.",Palo Alto,3,4
"Jaunt, a Palo Alto startup that makes software and 360 degree cameras for creating virtual reality films, is preparing an application for Gear VR.",Palo,3,3
"Jaunt, a Palo Alto startup that makes software and 360 degree cameras for creating virtual reality films, is preparing an application for Gear VR.",Alto,4,4
"It will allow users to access Jaunt s original content library, which features videos that are both visually and audibly a full 360 degrees.",N/A,-1,-1
"I think there will be some people that consume Jaunt VR using the Oculus Rift   and then there will be a lot of others consuming it on mobile,  Jaunt CEO Jens Christensen said in an interview.",N/A,-1,-1
That doesn t really matter to us.,N/A,-1,-1
The player should play equally well on a PC-based platform as it would on a mobile-based.,N/A,-1,-1
"That s thanks in part to the Gear VR-compatible Galaxy Note 4 s 2560 x 1440 resolution screen which, while it has A lower resolution than the screen planned for the final version of Oculus Rift, is more than enough to trick the brain into believing what it is seeing is real.",N/A,-1,-1
But it also has to do with the relatively small amount of processing power needed to play a video.,N/A,-1,-1
You can easily watch YouTube videos and even TV on a phone because the heavy computing is done in advance.,N/A,-1,-1
You don t need an Xbox-caliber machine to have a high-quality experience.,N/A,-1,-1
"If you have a headset plugged into a high powered PC or some other console, then you would have more processing power.",N/A,-1,-1
"That s important for a lot of applications, but it s less important for a cinematic VR viewer,  Christensen said.",N/A,-1,-1
We feel the consumer is giving up very little and gaining a lot by being untethered.,N/A,-1,-1
"While many of us do it anyway, it s generally not the most comfortable or healthy choice to stare at a small screen for hours at a time.",N/A,-1,-1
Jaunt gets that.,N/A,-1,-1
It s general practice will be to produce shorter films maybe 10 minutes that are suited specifically to virtual reality.,N/A,-1,-1
Shorter films are also suited to times when you d have a mobile device on you say a plane or a train when lugging around a corded Oculus Rift isn t exactly feasible.,N/A,-1,-1
Christensen wouldn t say which films will be the first available on Gear VR.,N/A,-1,-1
Jaunt will focus on offering a group of high-quality movies and then add more over time.,N/A,-1,-1
"We think VR really is the next platform beyond mobile,  Christensen said.",N/A,-1,-1
It s another extremely great validation point that the platform manufacturers are showing a real commitment to VR. ,N/A,-1,-1
"DigitalOcean will announce Friday that it is now supporting Linux OS specialist CoreOS, giving developers an easier way to deploy Docker containers on its platform.",N/A,-1,-1
"Users will now have the option to choose CoreOS as the base image that acts as the foundation for spinning up new servers; all a user has to do is create a droplet   a combination of compute, storage and networking resources   chose the region and location of the server, and then click on a CoreOS icon that will trigger the server s launch, explained Mitch Wainer, DigitalOcean s co-founder and chief marketing officer.",N/A,-1,-1
CoreOS has made a name for itself in recent months as a supplier of a custom-built Linux OS that can power Docker containers.,N/A,-1,-1
"With CoreOS running on DigitalOcean, users should be able to run Docker on DigitalOcean while also taking advantage of CoreOS s cluster management service and server-patching capabilities, said CoreOS CEO Alex Polvi.",Alex,32,32
"Demand for running Docker containers was apparently high within the DigitalOcean community; it was one of the most requested features, said Wainer.",N/A,-1,-1
"While users could spin up Docker containers before, Wainer said the Docker implementation the company had was  not as well optimized as the CoreOS distribution  and the CoreOS integration provides an easy way to  spin up cluster-service environments using Docker.",N/A,-1,-1

"According to a Thursday statement from Worldline mobility and e-transactional services chief:

The EEBus initiative is the most mature alliance we have found active in the standardization process of connected home and has an original approach.",N/A,-1,-1
It is not simply yet another protocol in the home.,N/A,-1,-1
"Moreover it provides ways to interconnect to most well established protocols such as ZigBee, KNX [and] EnOcean.",N/A,-1,-1

"Apple is to start notifying users when someone tries to restore iCloud data to a new device, in the wake of last week s big celebrity nude selfie hack   and it s also going to start using two-factor authentication as a security measure for accessing iCloud accounts from its mobile devices.",N/A,-1,-1
"Apple CEO Tim Cook told the Wall Street Journal late Thursday that the company would start sending out email and push notifications for iCloud data restoration in a couple weeks  time, and reiterated an earlier statement asserting that the hackers had correctly guessed security questions in order to change the victims  passwords, or used standard phishing techniques to fool the targets into giving up their Apple IDs and passwords.",Cook,3,3

In Apple s two-factor authentication system, which already protects Apple ID management and iTunes and App Store purchases when users turn it on, users have to log in with two of the following three things: a password, a short one-time code or the long key they were given at signup.",N/A,-1,-1
Cook said the upcoming iOS 8 operating system refresh would urge people more to use two-factor authentication   he said most customers don t use it currently   and would also allow them to use it to keep others out of their iCloud accounts.,Cook,0,0
"He also suggested that user awareness, rather than engineering, was ultimately the solution to user security   basically, people should have better passwords.",N/A,-1,-1

Motorola displayed a rather preternatural obsession with leather at its big Chicago device unveiling on Thursday.,Chicago,11,11
"Leather took its place among silicon, aluminum, titanium, steel and plastic as one of the key materials going into its phone designs, and Motorola wasn t shy about bragging about it.",N/A,-1,-1
"Four different color shades of leather are now among the choices for back covers in the Moto X, joining wood veneer and plastic in its Moto Maker custom phone design program.",N/A,-1,-1
Leather will also be the default option for wristbands on the new Moto 360 smartwatch.,N/A,-1,-1
Motorola apparently searched the world the far and wide to find a leather materials provider only to discover Horween Leather Company in its backyard.,N/A,-1,-1
"Horween runs a full-bore tannery just a mile away from its new Chicago HQ   and shocking to me, just a few blocks away from my apartment for six years.",Chicago,12,12
The company is supplying the custom phone cases and wristbands that Motorola hopes will differentiate it from the plastic and metal housings of its competitors.,N/A,-1,-1
"I ll admit, hands on, these designs look slick.",N/A,-1,-1
"While leather bands aren t unfamiliar on a watch, they definitely lend a supple and distinct feel to the Moto X handsets that I played with.",N/A,-1,-1
But I have to wonder how they would age.,N/A,-1,-1
"Perhaps in time they would develop a characteristic patina, similar to that of your favorite leather jacket or wallet.",N/A,-1,-1
"Then again, I also can t help thinking about what a year of pocket sweat would do for the phone s odor.",N/A,-1,-1
"There weren t many surprises at Motorola s big device unveiling in Chicago on Thursday, but then again Moto was hardly keeping its new portfolio secret.",Chicago,12,12
"The handset maker delivered newly updated versions of its Moto X and Moto G smartphones, and Motorola s high-end submission to the Android Wear world, the Moto 360, made its commercial debut.",N/A,-1,-1
"Lastly, it announced a new Bluetooth headset called the Hint.",N/A,-1,-1
Let s start with the Moto 360.,N/A,-1,-1
"The smartwatch was the most anticipated of the Android Wear devices previewed at Google I/O, and it delivered on its hype.",N/A,-1,-1
"Its round screen sets its apart from the LG G Watch and Samsung Gear Live, and during its demos Motorola emphasized the difficulties of making a round display in a world dominated by rectilinear screens.",N/A,-1,-1
"Of course, that means apps will need to be optimized for the 360 to take advantage of its unique display, but Motorola said any standard app distributed for Android Wear would work on the device.",N/A,-1,-1
"The pixels go all the way to watch s edges, making it look like an actual analog timepiece   albeit a big one   when inactive, and instead of plastic or rubber, Motorola is going with stainless steel and leather bands.",N/A,-1,-1
"As expected, the watch makes use of wireless charging, coming with a special stand on to which the watch face slides.",N/A,-1,-1
"That means there are no open ports anywhere on the device, helping make it water and dust resistant.",N/A,-1,-1
"It pairs with any smartphone running Google Android 4.3 or above using Bluetooth, and Motorola claims the wireless radio inside is powerful enough that you can leave your phone several rooms away and still access all of the 360 s app and internet functions.",N/A,-1,-1
"The 360 has a both a heart-rate monitor and pedometer, it responds to both touchscreen and Google Now voice commands, and it weighs in at 1.72 ounces.",N/A,-1,-1
But it s also priced higher than its LG and Samsung counterparts at $250.,N/A,-1,-1
"A version with a leather strap will go on sale Friday at Motorola.com, Google Play and Best Buy.",N/A,-1,-1
"A $300 version will go be available later this fall with a steel band, though the bands are interchangeable so you can buy a steel or leather band independently for $80 and $30 respectively.",N/A,-1,-1

"Motorola, however, wanted to keep the phone friendly for a single hand, so it thinned out its beveled edges making it easier to wrap your hand around its 7 millimeters of width.",N/A,-1,-1
"The new X has a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, a 13 Megapixel rear camera, and a slightly larger 2300 mAh battery.",N/A,-1,-1
"The Moto Maker customization program will carry over to the new Moto X, and it will feature a new material for the phone backing: leather.",N/A,-1,-1
Motorola has contracted with a Chicago tannery called Horween to custom-design back plates for the Moto X.,Chicago,5,5
The same company is making the straps for the Moto 360.,N/A,-1,-1
"As for software, the X comes with Motorola s no-frills interface and control software, but the vendor has added some interesting new capabilities to Moto Voice and Moto Actions.",N/A,-1,-1
Moto Voice s touchless interface now supports custom wake up commands.,N/A,-1,-1
"Instead of saying  Okay Google Now  you can customize the wake-up call sign of your phone, changing it to  Okay Shirley  or merely  Listen up.",Shirley,21,21
The X also makes use of infrared sensors for more subtle controls.,N/A,-1,-1
"When your hand approaches the screen it will automatically show your most recent notification, and when the phone is ringing a wave of the wrist over the phone s face will shut the ringer off.",N/A,-1,-1
"Here are the numbers on how it compares to the old model:

The Moto G is getting a similar spec facelift.",N/A,-1,-1
"The smartphone is designed to be an affordable device for global markets, and according to Motorola, it s become its best selling device to date.",N/A,-1,-1
"After polling its customers on what they wanted to see in the new version, the G is getting stereo speakers, more powerful cameras, a bigger 5-inch screen and improved quad-core processor.",N/A,-1,-1
"The Moto X will cost $100 with contract from the U.S. carriers, or unsubsidized and unlocked for $500.",N/A,-1,-1

The 360 wasn t the only wearable that Motorola introduced this week.",N/A,-1,-1
At the media event Moto trotted out a new Bluetooth earpiece called the Hint that may not be as functional as an Android Wear device but is definitely smarter than your typical wireless headset.,N/A,-1,-1
"The Hint, which will be available before the holidays for $150, is more an earbud than a headset, and Motorola said it is designed it to be worn all day.",N/A,-1,-1
While not exactly unnoticeable the device resembles a hearing aid that doesn t protrude beyond your earlobe.,N/A,-1,-1
"It uses two directional microphones to pick up on your conversation, but impressively it can be act as a conduit for the same voice commands you would use to control your phone.",N/A,-1,-1
"The Hint makes use of the same passive listening technology in the Moto X, so you can wake up your Moto X with a simple voice prompt when the headset is in your ear.",N/A,-1,-1
"It works with other voice command interfaces as well so you can use the Hint to query Apple s Siri, though to activate her you will need to press the capacitive touch sensor on the side of the earpiece.",N/A,-1,-1
"The device also contains IR sensors, so when the device is removed it will automatically shut off, making your phone active once again.",N/A,-1,-1

Google+ has been offering a similar feature for some time with its Auto-Awesome videos   but Boiman said that the company s products are very different.,N/A,-1,-1
"Google, he suggested, tries to summarize an event.",N/A,-1,-1
"Magisto s philosophy on the other hand is to evoke emotions, which can mean to focus on photos that help the story, but may not be the best overall shots.",N/A,-1,-1
"Magisto currently employs 40 people, and has 40 million registered users, according to Boiman.",N/A,-1,-1

"The size Ng is referring to is in terms of neural connections, not sheer server or node count, and will be accomplished via heavy use of graphics processing units, or GPUs.",N/A,-1,-1

A post we published at Gigaom on Thursday morning seems to have triggered a kind of flash fire in the Twitter-sphere.,N/A,-1,-1
The post referred to some recent comments from CFO Anthony Noto that suggested algorithmic filtering of some kind   similar to what Facebook does   is likely coming to Twitter.,Anthony,9,9
"My @ replies feed quickly turned into a maelstrom of disgust at the idea (interrupted by the occasional supportive tweet) and so I ve collected some of them below, and others in a Storify collection.",N/A,-1,-1
There s also a poll so you can tell us what you think.,N/A,-1,-1
"Just to recap, Noto said at a financial conference on Wednesday   as reported by the Wall Street Journal   that the standard reverse-chronological order of the Twitter was  not the most relevant experience for a user,  since it might mean that relevant or interesting tweets would be missed.",Wall,16,16
"Putting that content in front of them regardless of when it was posted, he said,  is a way to organize that content better.",N/A,-1,-1
"I took that to mean that algorithmic filtering or non-chronological rejigging of the Twitter timeline was probably coming soon   something that others have also said recently, including TechCrunch   even though many users have made it clear that they don t like algorithmic filtering, and that the non-filtered nature of Twitter is one of the main reasons they use that network instead of Facebook.",N/A,-1,-1
"Twitter CEO Dick Costolo said my interpretation was  an absurd synthesis  of what Noto said, but he also didn t deny that filtering is coming.",N/A,-1,-1
"Some responses to the post pointed out that filtering could occur under a revamped  Discover  tab, or with a toggle that would allow users to switch their default view between a filtered or unfiltered stream.",N/A,-1,-1
"But others pointed out that Facebook has such a toggle between relevance and chronological, and many users are reportedly unaware that their newsfeed is even filtered in the first place   so they never make use of that setting.",N/A,-1,-1
"As I tried to point out, the devil is in the defaults that any social service or platform provides to you, and how it is described.",N/A,-1,-1
"Sociologist Zeynep Tufekci, who has written about the difference between the algorithmic nature of Facebook s feed and Twitter s unfiltered experience in the context of the news from Ferguson, said in a follow-up post on Medium that she values the raw nature of the Twitter stream not just because it s chronological but because it is effectively filtered by human beings rather than algorithms   and algorithms might miss things of value, including posts from people or sources they don t see as important enough to highlight.",Ferguson,30,30
"Others made the same point:

A number of users noted that one of the main benefits of Twitter is that they get to control what they see by choosing whom to follow, and that giving up any of that control wasn t something they wanted to consider.",N/A,-1,-1
"Even if Twitter does provide filtering in a non-default tab, or allows for an opt-out, or is simply talking about experimenting with more algorithm-driven relevance features, it s quite clear that for many devoted users, tampering with their following list or stream is like touching the third rail of a subway track.",N/A,-1,-1
"Here are some more responses:

As I mentioned above, I ve collected those and others in a Storify module   including a number of positive comments from users who feel that algorithmic filtering would be helpful, especially for new users, and others who feel that the whole thing is a storm in a teapot and no one really cares whether their feed is filtered or not.",N/A,-1,-1

FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler Thursday said what everyone who pays a broadband bill outside a few select cities already knows: the country lacks a competitive broadband market.,Wheeler,3,3

"But before we mock this, recall that Washington politics is all about signaling and these words could have considerable impact.",Washington,8,8
"For example, given that the nation s top two cable providers are attempting to merge in a deal that would be horrendous for U.S. broadband and pay TV subscribers, is the agency perhaps telling Comcast that its efforts to say the deal is all about pay TV aren t holding water  Or reminding everyone that the cable companies, barring a few planned gigabit networks, are the purveyors of the dominant form of high speed broadband access in the U.S.",N/A,-1,-1
"The FCC, in other words, is specifically calling out the lack of competition when it comes to higher speeds.",N/A,-1,-1
"Wheeler s speech included the following chart to drive home this point:

Outside of the hidden messages, the Chairman offered clear statements.",Wheeler,0,0
"He called on the FCC to create principles to increase competition that are as follows:

Protect existing competition: The chairman pointed to the agency s efforts to oppose wireless mergers as an example of this and said that, when it comes to transitioning from older copper networks to newer IP networks, the shifts should not reduce competition.",N/A,-1,-1
"He did not mention Comcast s planned merger, which is the elephant in the room.",N/A,-1,-1
"Encourage competition where it can exist: In wireline, Wheeler mentioned both the power of last-mile providers and ensuring that last-mile access remains free from barriers.",Wheeler,10,10
"In wireless, he mentioned setting aside spectrum in the Broadcast Incentive Auction for alternative options which I m guessing refer to white spaces and Wi-Fi.",N/A,-1,-1
Create competition where none exists: He against referred to unlicensed spectrum as well as the current fight for Chattanooga s Electric Company to help provide gigabit services to nearby towns   something currently forbidden by state laws that were drafted with help from telecoms companies.,Chattanooga,19,19
"Provide broadband where competition can t exist: This was Wheeler s shout out to rural America, where wireline is both expensive to lay and there s little incentive to invest.",Wheeler,10,10
In those cases he said Universal Service Funds should help offset those costs to ensure that we don t get a digital divide between rural America and everywhere else.,N/A,-1,-1
"The principles aside, Wheeler also derided the agency s current definition of broadband at 4 Mbps.",Wheeler,4,4
"Speaking of the chart higher up in the story, he said:

He went further, indicating that 25 Mbps was really the current  tablestakes  goal for minimum broadband and pointed out that while a majority of American homes have access to 100 Mbps broadband, 40 percent do not.",N/A,-1,-1
"He called that unacceptable, while essentially tossing the efficacy of DSL lines out the window as a quality broadband option.",N/A,-1,-1
"The telcos have known this for more than a decade, but only when the threat of competition from cable companies deploying faster speeds and now Google s gigabit plans have prompted them to move faster in upgrading their networks.",N/A,-1,-1
"The Chairman said essentially the same things the Gig.U report I covered last month said: that gigabit isn t just fast, but it s spurring competitive investment that otherwise may never have happened.",N/A,-1,-1
"Wheeler likely irked the telco s further in explaining that mobile broadband isn t an adequate substitute for fixed broadband,  especially given mobile pricing levels and limited data allowances.",Wheeler,0,0
"We ve said this all along, and it s not like agency hasn t realized this for years, but saying it so publicly is a nice first step.",N/A,-1,-1
"So what s driving Wheeler to tell off the industry his agency regulates  My guess is that he realizes that creating any kind of meaningful network neutrality is impossible, so he has to go for the nuclear option.",Wheeler,4,4
"Not reclassification, but calling out the industry for the lack of competition that is why we need network neutrality in the first place.",N/A,-1,-1
"This is the first of several speeches the FCC will offer on this topic, we ll have to wait and see how the agency lines up its ideals on competition with policy-making.",N/A,-1,-1
It s much harder to say all of these things and then approve a merger that would put more American s under a broadband data cap and reduce the number of wireline broadband competitors or say no to a request to broaden the options businesses have for faster broadband access.,N/A,-1,-1
"But the chairman was also very clear that he s aiming to incentive competition, not mandate it.",N/A,-1,-1
Which means the behind-the-scenes negotiations between the agency and the ISPs may put the lie to Chairman s pro-competition rhetoric today in ways the average citizen won t see or understand until they are stuck paying $90 a month for 50 Mbps broadband that comes with a data cap.,N/A,-1,-1

Securitas s alarms are already equipped with radios that tap the 868 MHz bands used for many industrial communications purposes in Europe.,N/A,-1,-1
"That s the same band used by Sigfox s network, so to upgrade millions of alarms already in the field, Securitas need only send out a software update, Nicholls said.",Nicholls,31,31
"We often think of smartwatches, health trackers and connected consumer appliances when we think of the internet of things, but there s an industrial internet world whose operation won t be obvious to the general public but could become far bigger than the consumer internet of things.",N/A,-1,-1

"Have you ever connected an Android phone or tablet to a Chromebook  If so, you know what happens: Pretty much nothing.",N/A,-1,-1

"Android Police noticed that the latest Chrome OS beta version adds MTP support, letting you connect an Android device to a Chromebook so you can see and transfer files between them.",N/A,-1,-1
"MTP has long been used with Android for file transfers; it s the method used between Android and Windows or Android and Mac OS X, for example.",N/A,-1,-1
"Unfortunately, up to now MTP support wasn t part of Google s Chrome OS.",N/A,-1,-1
If you switch to the beta channel on your Chromebook you can get an early look at the function and start transferring files over USB.,N/A,-1,-1
"Those feeling less adventurous can simply wait for the function to arrive in the stable channel of Chrome OS, which is generally updated every six weeks.",N/A,-1,-1
"This official update follows another scenario that eliminates the need for a traditional computer when tinkering with Android: Last week, an experimental method to use the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) server tool arrived for Chromebooks.",N/A,-1,-1

"Sandvine has noticed that in the previous year, Facebook traffic increased by 60 percent on one mobile network, and by over 200 percent on one fixed wireline network, driven by people s Facebook feeds  video auto plays.",N/A,-1,-1
Facebook started rolling out the feature last September.,N/A,-1,-1
"The problem with Autoplay has been noticed before, but the theory is that a glut of ice bucket challenge videos has led to a marked rise in video content that might be playing, and thus, a rise in data usage.",N/A,-1,-1
But it isn t just Facebook.,N/A,-1,-1
"When Instagram added video to its service in June 2013, Sandvine data showed a corresponding spike in global network usage as well.",N/A,-1,-1
"This makes complete sense given the amount of data in a video, as the Sandvine blog points out:

That may sound shocking, but if you think back to the time pre-autoplay, your Facebook page would have been mainly text and images.",N/A,-1,-1
"Add in video, which is essentially 24-30 photos being displayed in your feed each second, and you can see how the data quickly adds up.",N/A,-1,-1
"So not only is your Facebook habit now sucking up more of your mobile (and wireline) bandwidth if you leave the feature on, the overall trend in social sites is about making sure you see these videos and they can engage you without you ever having to make the choice to click.",N/A,-1,-1

AT&T has hit a significant milestone in its 4G rollout.,N/A,-1,-1
The carrier said Thursday that its LTE network now arches over 300 million people in the U.S. or roughly 95 percent of the population.,N/A,-1,-1
"Ma Bell didn t give any indication that it was stopping its rollout, but reaching 300 million brings its 4G coverage just beyond Verizon s when it closed out its initial LTE rollout with 298 million Americans covered.",Bell,1,1
"There are still roughly 17 million Americans who can t get an AT&T LTE signal, but traditionally the big carriers never reach 100 percent network penetration.",N/A,-1,-1
Instead they leave the most rural areas of the country to the regional carriers with whom they strike roaming deals.,N/A,-1,-1
Verizon and Sprint have already started creating those roaming partnerships through two programs that let smaller carriers use their spectrum for LTE rollouts.,N/A,-1,-1
AT&T and T-Mobile seem content for now to make their LTE networks exclusive.,Mobile,5,5

It s also thin and light   8.5 mm wide and weighing in at only 150 grams.,N/A,-1,-1
"But the Lumia 830 s main selling point is its 10-megapiel PureView camera, which is claimed to have a very thin optical image stabilization system.",N/A,-1,-1
"It will retail for  330 ($429) in Europe and Asia later this month, and it s nice to see Microsoft take some of the camera technology it inherited from Nokia and bring it to more affordable handsets.",N/A,-1,-1
"Microsoft says the Lumia 730 Dual Sim and Lumia 735 are built for  selfies,  but they re really built to expand the Windows Phone footprint among price-sensitive consumers in countries without full smartphone penetration, which is the niche in which Microsoft s been having the most success with Windows Phone lately.",N/A,-1,-1
"The banner feature on both of these phones is a wide-angle 5-megapixel front-facing camera, but most consumers will end up appreciating that Windows Phone runs smoothly and well on lower-end hardware.",N/A,-1,-1
"Like the 830, these phones are packing Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 chips paired with a 4.7-inch, 720p display.",N/A,-1,-1

"Zubie, the maker of a device that plugs into your car and can help you track how well (or poorly) you are driving, has signed a partnership with insurance provider Progressive.",N/A,-1,-1
The agreement will let Zubie customers see how Progressive would charge them based on the driving data that Zubie collects.,N/A,-1,-1
"It s the first agreement of its kind for both companies, but it has been something both firms have been working toward for a while.",N/A,-1,-1
"For Progressive, which has been a pioneer in usage-based pricing, it wants to start getting out of the business of sending customers hardware in order to track their driving habits.",N/A,-1,-1
"Currently under a program called Snapshot, Progressive customers opt in to a device that plugs into their cars  on-board diagnostics(OBD) ports and shares their driving data with the insurer.",N/A,-1,-1
They use the device for six months and then send it back.,N/A,-1,-1
"In return, Progressive charges them based on how well they drive, presumably giving them a lower rate on their insurance.",N/A,-1,-1
(I can t see someone who gets a bad rate sticking with Progressive.,N/A,-1,-1

But dealing with connected devices isn t Progressive s business and it s CEO Glenn Renwick has said he is waiting eagerly for car manufacturers to offer the same data or another option to get that data so he doesn t have to ship anymore black boxes.",N/A,-1,-1
Zubie offers this chance.,N/A,-1,-1
"Dave Pratt, GM of Usage Based Insurance at Progressive, called this agreement the  first tangible step  toward that goal.",Pratt,1,1

"They will soon not only see the option to send their data to Progressive in hopes of paying less for insurance, but also see coupons and more when their check engine light comes on or their brakes need attention.",N/A,-1,-1

Veron explained that some of the limits were because thermostat and Protect are power constrained.,N/A,-1,-1

"This too comes in various models, ranging from $279 to $379.",N/A,-1,-1
I ve been using a $299 version of the Acer Chromebook 13 for the past week.,N/A,-1,-1
"As with any device, there are some appealing attributes and some that leave me wanting more.",N/A,-1,-1
I definitely prefer the overall design of this Chromebook to Acer s prior models.,N/A,-1,-1
"Where I felt those were a bit flimsy, the Chromebook 13 feels solid.",N/A,-1,-1
"Like its predecessors, it s made from plastic, but it doesn t look cheap.",N/A,-1,-1
Most textures are smooth and there s a nice recessed area around the keyboard to help the non-backlit keys stand out a little more.,N/A,-1,-1
"Overall, this laptop is relatively thin, measuring 0.7 inches from top to bottom with the screen closed.",N/A,-1,-1
"It has a slightly large footprint for a device with 13.3-inch display, though: 12.9 inches wide and 9 inches deep.",N/A,-1,-1
"Although it s a completely different device class, my 13-inch MacBook Pro is smaller in every dimension.",N/A,-1,-1
Part of this observation comes from the display bezel: It s at least 1.25 inches below the display and 0.75 inches around the top and sizes.,N/A,-1,-1
It seems like wasted space that makes the Chromebook 13 larger and heavier than it needs to be at 3.31 pounds.,N/A,-1,-1
"Of course, that means the keyboard and trackpad are generously roomy.",N/A,-1,-1
There s plenty of key travel and the plastic trackpad works well for navigation; it s also a giant clickpad that supports multi-finger gestures in Google Chrome OS.,N/A,-1,-1
"Input, then, is fine.",N/A,-1,-1
"So what about output  For an extra $20 over the base model, this Chromebook 13 has a 1920 x 1080 display as opposed to 1366 x 768 resolution on the $279 version.",N/A,-1,-1
It s not a higher-quality IPS panel but still has reasonably good viewing angles from left to right.,N/A,-1,-1
"Pull the display down toward you, though, and you ll see a negative image of what s on the screen.",N/A,-1,-1
"Overall, the 1080p matte display is good but not great.",N/A,-1,-1
One issue with 1080p on a Chromebook isn t Acer s fault at all.,N/A,-1,-1
Google s Chrome OS interface doesn t scale.,N/A,-1,-1
"By that I mean you can zoom in and out on web pages to adjust the size with no problem, but the taskbar icons are fairly small due to the high resolution.",N/A,-1,-1
All of my Chrome bookmarks and title bars in tabs are also small and don t adjust with the zoom setting.,N/A,-1,-1
It s a minor annoyance that I hope Google addresses soon as more 1080p Chromebooks hit the market.,N/A,-1,-1
"In terms of ports, radios and other bits, Acer s Chromebook 13 has all the ones you d expect: A pair of USB 3.0 (one on the side and one on the back), rear HDMI out, front webcam, SD card reader, headphones, stereo speakers underneath the chassis, Bluetooth 4.0 and fast 802.11ac Wi-Fi.",N/A,-1,-1
That s all fairly standard on a Chromebook.,N/A,-1,-1
"Nvidia s Tegra K1 is not, however, and it s nice to see a new chip option available.",N/A,-1,-1
"Up to now, only Samsung s ARM-based processor and various Intel chips have powered most Chromebooks.",N/A,-1,-1
"After using the Chromebook 13 extensively, I found performance to be acceptable for most tasks.",N/A,-1,-1
"Since Nvidia s chip is relatively new, it provides a little more overall horsepower than the original Samsung Chromebook and HP Chromebook 11, but I still prefer the extra oomph provided by Intel-powered systems.",N/A,-1,-1
"I often experienced a slight lag or delay, for example when switching to an input field on a web page and typing: It would take the Chromebook a second to start showing what I typed.",N/A,-1,-1
This behavior was occasional but noticeable.,N/A,-1,-1
"When interacting with Google+, I was often a step or two head of the computer as I waited for it to catch up.",N/A,-1,-1
I also waited for some complex or content-heavy web pages to load from time to time but this may have more to do with the 2 GB of memory in the test device.,N/A,-1,-1
"All in all, I wasn t blown away by performance; I was left wanting more.",N/A,-1,-1
"For those interested in benchmarks as opposed to or in addition to real-world experiences, I ran both the SunSpider and Octane tests in Guest mode on the Chromebook 13; both measure JavaScript performance.",N/A,-1,-1
"In SunSpider, where a smaller number is better, the best device result after multiple runs was 628.3 milliseconds.",N/A,-1,-1
The top Octane score turned in was 7104.,N/A,-1,-1
"These numbers, along with my experience, suggest that when it comes to performance of what most users will do on a Chromebook, the new Acer isn t a standout; instead, it s comparable to other devices with similar chips.",N/A,-1,-1
The real benefit to the Nvidia Tegra K1 is the chip s 192 graphics cores.,N/A,-1,-1
"These are great for graphic-intensive web apps that make use of WebGL, for example.",N/A,-1,-1
The issue I see is that there aren t yet many such apps.,N/A,-1,-1
"Instead, Chromebooks are more likely used for browsing typical web pages, checking email, watching videos and updating social networks.",N/A,-1,-1
"So in some sense, the big benefit of those graphics cores is more of a promise for future activities.",N/A,-1,-1
"Regardless of that, the chip seems power-efficient.",N/A,-1,-1
Acer claims this Full HD model can run for up to 11 hours.,N/A,-1,-1
"It s definitely an all-day device, although in my typical usage as a full-time work device, I was seeing between 9.5 and 10 hours of run-time.",N/A,-1,-1
"While that may fall short of the claim, it s great to work away from an outlet all day long.",N/A,-1,-1
"Again, for $299, you can buy the model I tested, which comes with 2 GB of memory and 16 GB of internal storage.",N/A,-1,-1
Drop down $20 and the only differences are the 1366 x 768 display plus a 13-hour battery life claim.,N/A,-1,-1
"For $379, Acer upgrades the tested model to 4 GB of memory and 32 GB of storage.",N/A,-1,-1
"Since I like to work full-time on a Chromebook and need a little more responsiveness, the Chromebook 13 isn t for me.",N/A,-1,-1
"I d rather spend a similar amount of money and gain some performance, even if it means I give up a little battery life and a 1080p screen.",N/A,-1,-1
"Typical mainstream consumers looking for general web activity and all-day battery life, however, ought to be happy with the new Acer.",N/A,-1,-1

"Lenovo might be known as the company behind the Thinkpad in the United States, but it actually sells more phones and tablets than it does laptops, nearly 16 million smartphones in the second quarter this year alone.",N/A,-1,-1
"A lot of those sales are coming from Lenovo s home country of China, which explains some of the choices made on the Vibe X2 and Vibe Z2, two new smartphones announced on Thursday.",China,13,13

"Those aren t bad specs, and they keep the Vibe X2 competitive with other Chinese phones in the same price range.",N/A,-1,-1

"Looking at the phone in profile, you can see definite striations and layers   three, in total   which give the phone a unique look.",N/A,-1,-1
"The other phone Lenovo announced is the Vibe Z2, which isn t to be confused with the decidedly high-end Vibe Z2 Pro.",N/A,-1,-1
"Instead of a MediaTek processor behind its 5.5-inch 720p screen, the Z2 is using a Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 SoC, which we ve seen before in other mid-range devices.",N/A,-1,-1
"Although it s not the fastest chip, it is using 64-bit cores, which means when Android officially releases a 64-bit compatible version, the Z2 should be able to take advantage.",N/A,-1,-1

"It already looks like Google s European search antitrust case will roll on for some time yet, thanks to a host of new complainants and some pertinent criticisms of the concessions Google has put on the table, but here s another voice calling for the Commission to reject that deal.",N/A,-1,-1
"On Thursday an informal coalition of European press publishers  associations said Google s proposed commitments were  wholly insufficient to restore competition, innovation and consumer choice to the digital market.",N/A,-1,-1
"Helmut Heinen, the president of the Federation of German Newspaper Publishers (BDZV), said in a statement that the deal would  effectively legalise Google s abusive self-preference.",N/A,-1,-1
"The antitrust case has been going on for four years now and it has several aspects, but the big remaining blocker is the way in which Google presents results from smaller search engines that operate in specific vertical industries, like Yelp or TripAdvisor.",N/A,-1,-1
"Currently Google, which has around 95 percent of the EU search market, gives preference to its own results, sometimes shuffling those rivals off to the second page or worse.",N/A,-1,-1
Its proposed concessions would involve an auction process for rivals to pay for greater prominence at the top of the first page.,N/A,-1,-1
The publishers pointed out in their analysis that ranking rivals  results by their willingness to pay for prominence is hardly an improvement in the context of Google s EU monopoly.,N/A,-1,-1
"As a new type of ad, Rival Links are not a concession but a new revenue stream for Google,  they said.",N/A,-1,-1
You may be wondering why publishers are so bothered about this ecommerce stuff.,N/A,-1,-1
One reason is that traditional paper publishing giants are these days getting into the vertical search market in a big way.,N/A,-1,-1
"Germany s Axel Springer, for example, owns property, jobs and local discovery platforms.",Springer,3,3
But that s not their only gripe.,N/A,-1,-1
"One of the other strands of the Google antitrust case involves its scraping of content from third parties, and that s very much the same kind of complaint these publishers have previously levied at Google News   witness the Google tax laws that have popped up in Spain and Germany following furious publisher lobbying.",N/A,-1,-1
"Indeed, Google News is part of this case too, albeit a relatively minor one.",N/A,-1,-1
"Hence this element of the publishers associations  broadside on Thursday:

The publishers are complaining that, if they opt out of having snippets of their content appear in Google News, that also has  detrimental effects on the ranking or appearance of that website in the general web search; a consequence that no content provider can risk.",N/A,-1,-1
"Google has promised to protect the publishers  rankings in general search results whatever they do, but the publishers claim it can still punish them by kicking them out of the  News-Universals  block of the most relevant news results at the top of a standard web search page.",N/A,-1,-1
"What s more, the publishers have noticed that Google is promising product, local and travel search rivals the ability to mark up particular information on their pages that Google cannot scrape.",N/A,-1,-1
"This only amounts to a maximum of 10 percent of the readable text on each page, but the publishers say this still shows Google can give them something better than the  simplistic opt-out variations [i.e.",N/A,-1,-1

These publishers come with considerable political clout.,N/A,-1,-1
"Even though their complaints about Google News are misguided   the service sends traffic their way so they should stop whingeing and being greedy   their overall contribution to this case will give the Commission yet another reason to reject Google s third set of commitment revisions, and kick the matter down to whichever poor sod succeeds outgoing Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia in November.",Joaquin,59,59
I think we can all agree that vacuuming isn t fun.,N/A,-1,-1

"Heck yes, I ll vacuum my apartment if it rolls around on a big silver ball!",N/A,-1,-1
"Despite it being a vacuum company, Dyson has done a really good job of positioning itself as futuristic.",N/A,-1,-1
"And today, it played into that when it announced a robotic vacuum cleaner.",N/A,-1,-1
"The 360 Eye will first debut in Japan in spring 2015, followed by the rest of the world later in the year.",N/A,-1,-1
The vacuum is the first product to come out of Dyson s heavy investments in a robotics team.,N/A,-1,-1
"The 360 Eye is the same concept as a Roomba, but it relies on a 360-degree camera and infrared sensor to actually map a room while vacuuming it, as opposed to the Roomba s method of just bumping back and forth between obstacles and hoping for the best.",N/A,-1,-1
The 360 Eye reportedly knows exactly what parts of a room it has covered and makes sure it gets every last corner clean.,N/A,-1,-1
"As with its other vacuums, Dyson claims that the 360 Eye has better suction than other robot options.",N/A,-1,-1
It supposedly nabs particles down to 0.5 microns in size by separating dust and dirt while cleaning.,N/A,-1,-1
"It also uses a carbon fiber brush that crosses the entirety of the machine, which Dyson says picks up grime more completely than the spinning side brushes iRobot uses on its robots.",N/A,-1,-1
The 360 Eye has a battery life of 20-30 minutes.,N/A,-1,-1
"When the battery is low, it automatically docks itself.",N/A,-1,-1
Users can program a cleaning schedule and check in on the robot s status from a mobile app.,N/A,-1,-1
"While robotic vacuum cleaners are initially very convenient, they do have some pitfalls.",N/A,-1,-1

"Apple uses two-factor authentication (2FA) as a protection for Apple ID management and iTunes and App Store purchases, but not for iCloud backups, which is where many of these pictures originated.",N/A,-1,-1
"Even where the company does employ 2FA, it doesn t exactly make it easy.",N/A,-1,-1
"What s more, as Nik Cubrilovic wrote in his excellent in-depth analysis of underground marketplaces and forums, Apple makes it far too easy to execute so-called brute force attacks on its iCloud login system.",N/A,-1,-1
"By testing out various email addresses as he tries to set up a new iCloud account, the attacker can easily tell whether or not they re already associated with an existing account.",N/A,-1,-1
"If he s already got the target s email address and date of birth, and has used social engineering or other means to learn likely answers to the target s security questions, he has everything he needs to reset the password and log into the real account.",N/A,-1,-1
"So when Apple said the attack wasn t a  breach  of its iCloud systems, it was really saying the security wasn t any weaker than the company already knew to be the case.",N/A,-1,-1
"There is clear room for improvement, perhaps using the time-based one-time password algorithm (TOTP) that Google deploys quite successfully in its Authenticator 2FA app.",N/A,-1,-1
"That said, security is generally in a bad place right now.",N/A,-1,-1
"We should all use strong passwords and long random strings for our security answers, but they re a pain to remember and they re not exactly mobile-friendly.",N/A,-1,-1
"Biometrics may help here, though if you have a very determined attacker they re not foolproof either.",N/A,-1,-1
"It seems to be the case that the hundreds of photos and videos published online came from a compilation of files that people had bought in a more scattered fashion in various marketplaces   hackers show censored previews of hacked pictures on these forums, then send the uncensored versions after their customers pay them.",N/A,-1,-1
"The thing is, we re not just talking about actresses, singers and models.",N/A,-1,-1
"Creeps show up on these forums asking people to hack someone they know, giving them the Facebook profile links and other information they know through personal interaction with that person, to help them do this.",N/A,-1,-1
Both the requester and the hacker end up with copies of the hacked data.,N/A,-1,-1
As Cubrilovic wrote:  This was one of the most unsettling aspects of these networks to me   knowing there are people out there who are turning over data on friends in their social networks in exchange for getting a dump of their private data.,N/A,-1,-1
"I ll admit that, when the news of the big celebrity hack broke earlier this week, part of me thought the victims should be taking extra precautions because of their public prominence.",N/A,-1,-1
This was the wrong approach.,N/A,-1,-1
"Anyone can be a target of these attacks   and they re no less violated if the stolen material only finds itself in the hands of a few creeps, rather than the wider public.",N/A,-1,-1
This is everyone s problem.,N/A,-1,-1
"Andy Greenberg at Wired wrote a great piece on a software tool called the ElcomSoft Phone Password Breaker (EPPB), which is distributed by a Russian security outfit.",N/A,-1,-1
"It s supposed to be for law enforcement officials and intelligence agencies, but ElcomSoft happily sells it to individuals as well (bootlegs can be found for free, too.",N/A,-1,-1
")

EPPB allows a hacker to impersonate the target s device and download its full backup   an even more dangerous scenario than being able to sneak into someone s iCloud account.",N/A,-1,-1
"As he told the BBC, even ElcomSoft chief Vladimir Katalov reckons his tool was used to glean some of the celebrities  nude selfies.",N/A,-1,-1
The implications of the free availability of tools like EPPB are very serious.,N/A,-1,-1
"For one thing, the situation shows how the intrusive capabilities of much modern law enforcement may spin out of control   it s very hard to ensure that this power stays in the  right  hands.",N/A,-1,-1
"By extension, it follows that adequate protection against such techniques, which may be necessary to keep the creeps out, will also stymie law enforcement and intelligence agencies to a degree.",N/A,-1,-1
"Which brings us to the next point 

The falling cost of storage and bandwidth makes it a no-brainer to back up everything, all the time and forever.",N/A,-1,-1
Perhaps too much of a no-brainer.,N/A,-1,-1
"Do we really need to store everything in this fashion 

The problem with taking this approach is we forget what we have.",N/A,-1,-1
"Even speaking as someone who doesn t back up much stuff in the cloud (yeah I m one of those guys), the falling cost of external hard drive space has led me to have multiple copies of who-knows-what stored in nested directories across multiple devices.",N/A,-1,-1
"In the case of years  worth of photos, that s generally a good thing, but even then I know I m keeping way more than is necessary.",N/A,-1,-1
I just can t be bothered to sort through it to establish what s necessary and what s not.,N/A,-1,-1
"This is the modern approach but it may not be a smart one, particularly when it comes to the cloud.",N/A,-1,-1
"Because, even if Apple and all the other providers stick decent 2FA on their login systems, a truly determined attacker with sufficient resources will probably still find his way through.",N/A,-1,-1
"This comes down to simply having less data out there that could be stolen, and I m not sure of the best way to achieve such a thing   user education may be part of it, but it s really down to the systems that enable such permanent, indiscriminate memory by default.",N/A,-1,-1
"Perhaps they should encourage a more granular, choosy approach.",N/A,-1,-1
"Speaking for myself, I know there s a lot of data I ve created that I d rather see disappear than fall into the wrong hands.",N/A,-1,-1
"I m not going to harp on too much about this because I regularly do so anyway, but throwing all your eggs in one basket is generally going to make them less secure.",N/A,-1,-1
"It s unlikely that Apple s iCloud was the only place from which all these photos and video were purloined, but it does seem to have been a major source.",N/A,-1,-1
"A tool like EPPB is only as useful as it is because so many people use the same system with the same front door   if you have a decentralized model with federated systems that plug into one another, but are stored on a mix of providers  and self-hosted servers, the hacker s job is made that much harder.",N/A,-1,-1
"However, while decentralized systems are getting there, they re not yet ready for mass adoption.",N/A,-1,-1
"In the meantime, as Cubrilovic recommended, people should use a private email address that even friends don t know about for their sensitive online accounts, such as those for banking or cloud storage, then use a different email address for more social activities.",N/A,-1,-1

"Music streaming service Rdio relaunched its Android, iOS and web apps Thursday with a new focus on personalized radio streams.",N/A,-1,-1
The relaunch comes in conjunction with the launch of a new free tier that is meant to help accelerate Rdio s growth while also opening up a whole new revenue stream based on advertising.,N/A,-1,-1
"It s Rdio s most ambitious relaunch to date, and it could be critical to the company s attempts to compete with Spotify as well as the Apple-acquired Beats Audio as well as the true audience magnets in the digital music space: Pandora and YouTube.",N/A,-1,-1
Rdio s transition from a purely subscription-based service to one that more squarely competes with Pandora has been a long time coming.,N/A,-1,-1
"Company representatives first told me about plans to incorporate leanback-type listening in early 2012, and Rdio launched personalized radio stations that were modeled after Pandora a year ago.",N/A,-1,-1
"At the same time, the company s business evolved from a singular focus on subscriptions towards one with multiple revenue streams.",N/A,-1,-1
"The most significant step in that direction was a pact with U.S. radio giant Cumulus that included Cumulus buying a stake of up to 15 percent in Rdio, as well as a partnership on ad sales for a future online radio service.",N/A,-1,-1
"Rdio went on to strike partnerships with other terrestrial radio networks in other key markets, and Rdio s SVP of Product Chris Becherer told me this week that the company is now launching a free, ad-supported radio product in 20 of its 60 markets.",N/A,-1,-1
"With those partnership also comes a new focus: Sure, the company would still love for users to eventually pay for its service, but it doesn t mind if a significant amount of users stays with the free tier.",N/A,-1,-1
"We have a business model that supports that,  Becherer said.",N/A,-1,-1
Embracing free streaming also meant for Rdio that it had to change how users experience its service.,N/A,-1,-1
"In the past, free streaming always felt like a very limited proposition.",N/A,-1,-1
"Now, Rdio retooled its entire onboarding process as well as the home screen of its apps and website to make free users feel more welcome.",N/A,-1,-1
"Gone is the long list of album covers that used to greet Rdio users, and gone is also the contact list that always made Rdio feel like it wanted to be a chat service without the ability to actually chat.",N/A,-1,-1
"Replacing all of this a new news feed-like experience that Becherer likened to Facebook, but that actually is a lot more like YouTube s homepage, albeit with a better, far less busy design.",N/A,-1,-1
"Rdio s news feed always offers users access to the albums, radio stations and playlists they ve listened to most recently, and then adds a mix of curated recommendations, deep dives on certain artists and social cues.",N/A,-1,-1
"I got to play a little bit with the new version of Rdio on the web as well as on Android Wednesday, and at first, that feed felt a bit random, and heavy on curated recommendations that I didn t actually care all that much about.",N/A,-1,-1
"However, I quickly got hooked on the  dig deeper  feature, which lets you explore other, and frequently more obscure titles by an artist you ve been listening to, and I also got to like the way Rdio now exposes similar artists right within that feed.. Rdio also started to mix in comments from your contacts, which gives the whole thing a bit more of a Facebook or Tumblr feeling, or as Becherer put it:  It just feels more like a magazine rather than a service.",N/A,-1,-1
"As part of the relaunch, Rdio also did a whole lot of clean-up around the edges.",N/A,-1,-1
"Synced tracks, which premium users can play on mobile devices without internet connectivity, are now called downloads, and users don t have to add whole albums to their collection anymore, but can instead just mark them as favorites, which similarly works for stations, artists, or single songs.",N/A,-1,-1
"All of this is part of an effort to rid the service of metaphors that may have made sense back when music services were still just catering to folks with really large record collections, but don t have a place in a world where Pandora has close to 80 million monthly active listeners.",N/A,-1,-1
Rdio isn t alone with its attempt to win over some of those listeners from Pandora.,N/A,-1,-1
"Fellow subscription music service Rhapsody has been targeting the online radio crowd with its unRadio product, which it rolled out in the U.S. in partnership with T-Mobile, and recently brought to France, and consumer electronics giant Samsung has been making some waves with its Milk music service.",Mobile,28,28
"Even with some differences in their execution, the logic between all of those efforts is the same: A significant amount of consumers may not be ready, or ever willing, to shell out $10 a month for on-demand access to many millions of tracks.",N/A,-1,-1
"the roadblock isn t just the cost of such a subscription, but also changing music consumption behavior, with people moving away from listening to entire albums, and towards a more passive, curated experience.",N/A,-1,-1
"However, even with a new revenue stream, Rdio remains a small player in this game, and Apple s recent Beats acquisition as well as YouTube s soon-to-launch subscription service put further pressure on the company.",N/A,-1,-1
"ne could argue that, in light of these developments, relaunching the service with a heavy focus on free streaming isn t just about stealing users away from Pandora.",N/A,-1,-1
It s also about demonstrating the kind of growth that potential buyers like to see in a company.,N/A,-1,-1

"But I found his post fascinating   not so much because of what he said in it, but because of what the phenomenon he is describing can tell us about the disruption of the traditional media landscape.",N/A,-1,-1
"In his post, Herrman calls the profusion of posts on such news events an  evolutionary defense against attention surplus,  as every media outlet large or small scrambles to cover whatever the trending topic of the day is   regardless of whether they have anything to add in the form of reporting, or analysis, or additional background on the story:

At one point, Herrman describes the impetus for this explosion of content by saying that writers for almost every media or news site found themselves  under the spell of that horrible force that newspaper columnists feel every week, the one that eventually ruins every last one: the dreadful pull of a guaranteed audience.",N/A,-1,-1

Apple had  better call Saul    or someone like him.,N/A,-1,-1

Apple s latest legal predicament comes as the result of a California judge s refusal last week to throw out the lawsuit.,California,11,11
The lawsuit itself was filed last September on behalf of Breaking Bad fans who bought a  Season Pass  for what they believed to be the final season of the show.,N/A,-1,-1
"Instead, the fans received only 8 episodes of the show   and then learned they had to pay once more to receive the last eight episodes.",N/A,-1,-1
The source of the controversy appears to have stemmed from a decision on the part of the studio to split the last 16 episodes into  Season 5  and the  Final Season    a decision of which Apple appears to have been unaware of when it marketed an iTunes season pass that promised  every episode in that season.,N/A,-1,-1
"Apple quickly responded by emailing Breaking Bad fans with an apology for the  confusion  and a $22.99 iTunes credit, enough to purchase the remaining episodes in high definition.",N/A,-1,-1
"The lawsuit, however, has trundled on all the same.",N/A,-1,-1
"In the latest ruling, U.S. District Judge Edward Davila agreed to throw out some of the claims, but ruled the plaintiffs could go forward with a false advertising claim based on California s unfair competition law.",California,33,33

Broadcom aims to change that with a new wireless chipset that will boost theoretical connection speeds from a smartphone or tablet to the Wi-Fi router to 650 Mbps.,N/A,-1,-1
"That may not be gigabit speed, but gigabit speed was always a bit of misnomer anyway   it s more an indication of overall network capacity rather than how quickly any given device could connect to the network.",N/A,-1,-1

"4Chan has not explained its decision to implement the DMCA protections, which require certain steps such as providing an email address where copyright owners can notify a site of violations.",N/A,-1,-1
But it s a safe bet that the decision was tied to the outrage surrounding the recent publication by 4Chan users of photographs stolen from Jennifer Lawrence and other actresses.,Lawrence,26,26
"4Chan is not the only site where the photographs have appeared, but it has been mentioned in multiple news reports about the hack, and it already has a reputation for nudity and misogyny.",N/A,-1,-1

"The real reason that 4Chan changed its policy, though, likely has little to do with a shift in Poole s personal views.",N/A,-1,-1
"Instead, it looks more like a frantic legal tactic to protect Poole from copyright lawsuits from Lawrence and others.",Lawrence,17,17
"By now, Poole s lawyers have probably advised him that copyright owners must register their photographs with the Copyright Office in order to collect what is known as  statutory damages    which allow owners to collect up to $150,000 for every infringing photograph.",N/A,-1,-1
"4Chan, in other words, has likely raced to erect the DMCA shield before the celebrities register their photos.",N/A,-1,-1
"At the same time, the implementation of the DMCA may also be an attempt by 4Chan to demonstrate a measure of social responsibility at a time when the FBI and others are vowing to take action against those responsible for the leak.",N/A,-1,-1
"Poole and others may be particularly worried over the fact that one of the celebrities in the photos was under 18 years of age   meaning that law enforcement may be able to use child pornography laws, which are far easier to use when it comes to obtaining convictions related to the uploading of photographs.",N/A,-1,-1

"Why is this so important  Because as Gillmor put it in his post:  when we use centralized services like social media sites  we are handing over ultimate control to third parties that profit from our work, material that exists on their sites only as long as they allow.",N/A,-1,-1
And that s not open at all.,N/A,-1,-1
The Isis mobile wallet just got a new name: Softcard.,N/A,-1,-1
"For those of you that haven t been keeping up with global affairs, another organization called ISIS   English shorthand for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria   has been dominating the headlines, known for its acts of terror rather than smartphone payments.",English,18,18
"Given the horrible coincidence, Isis announced in July it would rebrand.",N/A,-1,-1
Today we re getting a preview of that strategy.,N/A,-1,-1
"The consortium, which is made up of carriers Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile, will excise the Isis name from its app, service and all marketing (technically Isis operates under the name JVL Ventures), and in a few weeks it will replace its existing mobile wallet app in the iTunes and Google Play stores with a new Softcard-branded versions.",Mobile,16,16
As existing Isis customers update their wallets the Isis name will disappear from their phones.,N/A,-1,-1
"Isis is also getting a new website under the URL gosoftcard.com, though the current paywithisis.com URL will redirect to the new page.",N/A,-1,-1
"Even before the negative connotations of its moniker began to surface, Isis was already struggling to popularize its mobile wallet in a U.S. market that just wasn t taking to smartphone payments.",N/A,-1,-1
"The name change will help with PR, but it Softcard is facing an increasing amount of competition.",N/A,-1,-1
Apple is expected to announce its mobile wallet offer next week for the new iPhone.,N/A,-1,-1
"And today, the MCX consortium of the top U.S. retailers announced its smartphone payments app will go live in 2015.",N/A,-1,-1
Toshiba added its name to the growing list of companies that offer a 1080p Chromebook on Wednesday.,N/A,-1,-1
"The company introduced its Chromebook 2, a revision to the model it announced in January.",N/A,-1,-1
The Chrome OS device still has a 13-inch display but now there s an upgrade option for a full HD experience.,N/A,-1,-1
"Last week, Toshiba s Australia site actually leaked the new Chromebook 2 but only provided limited details.",N/A,-1,-1
"We know, for example, that Toshiba was adding support for faster 802.11ac wireless networks while also swapping the Intel chip inside the device.",N/A,-1,-1
"Instead of an Intel Haswell processor, the Chromebook 2 uses a more power efficient Intel Bay Trail chip.",Bay,16,16
That s why the new device will gain more run time on a single charge: up to 11.5 hours.,N/A,-1,-1
"That battery rating is for a lower-end model, however.",N/A,-1,-1
"For $249, the Chromebook 2 is equipped with the same 1366 x 768 display resolution as its predecessor, along with 2 GB of memory.",N/A,-1,-1
"Spend $329, however, and you ll get a 1920 x 1080 display with IPS screen for vivid color repoduction and improved viewing angles.",N/A,-1,-1
That model gets double the memory but will only run for 9 hours on a charge.,N/A,-1,-1
Thew new Chromebook 2 also went on a diet: It s slightly smaller all around and weighs 2.95 pounds compared to the 3.3 pound version I reviewed earlier this year.,N/A,-1,-1
Look for the new Chromebook 2 to be available in early October here in the U.S.; I m hoping to get a review unit between now and then to compare this version with the prior unit.,N/A,-1,-1
"I m sure the new IPS display and battery life will be welcome but as I said on this week s Chrome Show podcast, moving to a Bay Trail chip will lessen the overall performance of the device.",Bay,28,28
"Toshiba isn t the only Chromebook maker that offers a 1080p display, of course.",N/A,-1,-1
Samsung s follow up Chromebook does the same although the company opted to use its own ARM-based chip inside and chose a lower quality screen for the 1080p model.,N/A,-1,-1
"Verizon failed to inform 2 million customers of their right to opt out of certain marketing campaigns, and for that the company will pay $7.4 million to the U.S. Treasury.",N/A,-1,-1
"In a press release issued on Wednesday morning, the FCC explained that the penalty stems from Verizon s failure to notify some customers on their initial phone bill that it would use their personal information, including calling records, to promote other Verizon services.",N/A,-1,-1
"A related consent decree further states that Verizon voluntarily notified the FCC in January of 2013 after it determined that  a subset of its consumer, small business and medium business customers did not receive the opt-out notice on their initial bill.",N/A,-1,-1
"In an ensuing investigation, the company told the agency that it used the customer information in thousands of internal marketing campaigns dating from 2006.",N/A,-1,-1
The FCC describes the $7.4 million penalty as the  largest such payment in FCC history   related solely to the privacy of telephone customers  personal information.,N/A,-1,-1
"While the number is eye-catching, the actual offense appears fairly minor: Verizon failed to include an opt-out notice on some phone bills, leading some customers to be subject to more marketing than they would like.",N/A,-1,-1
"While this is still technically a privacy violation, it s hardly as egregious as some of those committed recently by tech and app companies.",N/A,-1,-1
It s possible that the Verizon penalty is intended in part to be a warning signal to the industry at a time when carriers are considering ways to make money off the consumer data they possess.,N/A,-1,-1
"Here s a link to the consent decree, which sets out all the specifics.",N/A,-1,-1
"After launching and later pulling its Here Maps from iOS, Nokia is ready to give it another try.",N/A,-1,-1
And this time it s also going to support Google Android devices.,N/A,-1,-1
"The company will launch a new maps application for both platforms before year s end, it told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday.",Wall,19,19
The mapping software recently launched on Samsung devices but this news will expand availability.,N/A,-1,-1
"Here Maps will be free for both iOS and Android, so how will Nokia compete for downloads against both Apple Maps and Google Maps 

If you ve used Here Maps on a Microsoft Windows or Windows Phone device lately, you ll likely have a good idea.",N/A,-1,-1
The software compares well against competitors with both navigation and general mapping but also has additional features to help make it stand out.,N/A,-1,-1
"You don t need an internet connection to see or search maps, for example.",N/A,-1,-1
"Google Maps does support some offline mapping capabilities, but users have to pre-install map data for specific locations in advance.",N/A,-1,-1
"With free downloads and no ads, even if Nokia builds a bigger following for Here Maps, it won t be making money directly from its mobile users, at least not in the short term.",N/A,-1,-1
"However, it will gain important data to continue making Here Maps a better product, which it also sells to corporate clients.",N/A,-1,-1
"By expanding the reach of its software, then, Nokia stands to gain a bigger business with a more robust product to sell.",N/A,-1,-1
"Sony has revealed its latest top-end Xperia mobile lineup: the 5.2-inch Z3 smartphone, the smaller but similar 4.6-inch Z3 Compact smartphone, and the 8-inch Z3 Tablet Compact.",N/A,-1,-1
The new devices were shown off at IFA in Berlin on Wednesday.,Berlin,9,9
"On the smartphone side, the big news here is really battery life: Sony is claiming a full two days of normal usage, thanks to improvements like the caching of static images so the screen doesn t need to keep refreshing.",N/A,-1,-1
"The Xperia Z1 was rated for 1.2 days and its successor, the Z2, for 1.4 days.",N/A,-1,-1
"I currently have a Z1 Compact and it gives me a full two days of light-to-moderate usage, so I m intrigued to see how the new phones fare in reality.",N/A,-1,-1
The phones also now have improved 20.7-megapixel cameras.,N/A,-1,-1
"Sony s new G lens for Xperia gives a 25mm focal length, which is a bit wider than the 27mm lens found in the Z1 and Z2 lines.",N/A,-1,-1
"With ISO sensitivity up to 12800, it should also produce low-light shots with less graininess.",N/A,-1,-1
Video capabilities now include improved steady-shot and an intelligent active mode for people who are shooting in-motion subjects while also being in motion.,N/A,-1,-1
"Those shooting video can now also pause and resume recording, and the devices record in 4K.",N/A,-1,-1
There s also an updated camera app with features such as multi-camera   an interesting toy if you have multiple Xperia devices   as well as sound-augmented photos and so on.,N/A,-1,-1
"It s worth noting, though, that the Z3 Tablet Compact (pictured right attached to a PS4 controller   it s the only tablet that can manage this) has a poorer camera than the phones   only 8 megapixels.",N/A,-1,-1
"It also has less battery life, offering up to 13 hours of video playback.",N/A,-1,-1
"That said, Sony is touting its credentials as the thinnest (8.6mm) and lightest (270g) waterproof tablet out there.",N/A,-1,-1
"On the subject of hardiness, all three devices are now dust-tight, with an IP68 rating.",N/A,-1,-1
"As with earlier models, they re also waterproof down to 4.9 feet for up to half an hour.",N/A,-1,-1
"In terms of audio, an area where Sony has a fair amount of pedigree, the flagship Xperia devices now support hi-res audio, which is good news for those shelling out big bucks to buy special versions of their favorite albums from the likes of iTrax, and who have capable headphones or speakers to match.",N/A,-1,-1
"The mobile devices can also  upscale  standard local tunes and streaming music to a higher quality, Sony says   I remain skeptical about the ability to detect audio information lost in compression, however.",N/A,-1,-1
"All three devices are based on a 2.5GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 chipset   a mild bump up from the 2.3GHz variant found in the current flagship Z2 smartphone and the Z2 tablet, and a bigger upgrade from the 2.2GHz Snapdragon 801 processor found in the Z1 Compact.",N/A,-1,-1
"The Z3 is 7.3mm thick and slightly lighter than the Z2 at 152g rather than 163g, though it has the same screen size as its predecessor.",N/A,-1,-1
"It also has more rounded edges, to protect the phone if dropped.",N/A,-1,-1
"The Z3 Compact is again a bit thinner and lighter than the Z1 Compact (8.6mm and 129g, rather than 9.5mm and 137g) but remains roughly the same size, even though its screen is bigger than the 4.3-inch affair on that model (say bye-bye to much of the bezel).",N/A,-1,-1
"As with the earlier version, it has a 720p rather than 1080p screen   suitable for its size.",N/A,-1,-1
"It also has 2GB of RAM whereas the bigger Z3 has 3GB, and uses translucent plastic rather than aluminum around the edges.",N/A,-1,-1
Sony also outed a new phone on the cheaper side of things.,N/A,-1,-1
"The E3 comes with a quad-core 1.2GHz processor, has a 4.5-inch screen and a 5-megapixel camera, and isn t waterproof   this one is intended for Latin America and India, though it will probably also be available in the U.S.

None of these devices have prices yet, though as Sony hasn t shared those details.",N/A,-1,-1
"Sony revealed two new wearables at IFA on Wednesday: the SmartBand Talk and the SmartWatch 3, the firm s first Android Wear device.",N/A,-1,-1
"The SmartWatch 3 comes with a 1.6-inch 320 320 transflective display, which is a bit more resolution than its predecessor had.",N/A,-1,-1
"It also comes with GPS and, like the SmartBand products, it comes with a life-logger application.",N/A,-1,-1
"Sony s decision to go with Google Android Wear software will surprise many people, as the company had previously ploughed ahead with its own watch software.",N/A,-1,-1
"The shift means less development stress for Sony, of course, though Android Wear is also yet to prove itself.",N/A,-1,-1
"Physically, the SmartWatch 3 is (in my opinion) a clear improvement on its predecessors, with the watch face blending into the strap rather than hanging on as a boxy attachment.",N/A,-1,-1
"It will cost  230 ($302) in Europe, though that s including tax.",N/A,-1,-1
"Still, it s on the pricey side for Android Wear.",N/A,-1,-1
"It comes in black or lime, with pink and white straps available for an extra  25 each.",N/A,-1,-1
"Unlike the first SmartBand, the SmartBand Talk comes with a curved 1.4-inch, 288 128-pixel e-ink display for email notifications and so on.",N/A,-1,-1
"As the name suggests, it also has a microphone and speaker for voice commands, and can also be used to handle calls over Bluetooth.",N/A,-1,-1
"However, with a 70mAh battery, they d better be short calls.",N/A,-1,-1
The SmartBand Talk also comes with an accelerometer and altimeter   handy for climbers.,N/A,-1,-1
"It will cost  160, with a pack of two extra bands costing  25.",N/A,-1,-1
"Both wearables are waterproof down to 4.9 feet for up to half an hour, just like Sony s flagship Xperia smartphones.",N/A,-1,-1
"In 2012, dozens of big retailers like Walmart, Target, CVS and Best Buy banded together to create their own smartphone payments network and mobile wallet.",N/A,-1,-1
"Two years later, that payment platform finally has a name, CurrentC, and a launch timeline, 2015.",N/A,-1,-1
"The Merchant Customer Exchange, or MCX, has private pilots going on in several member stores in different parts of the country, but on Wednesday it said it would expand that pilot program to many more stores throughout 2014 and launch commercially in 2015 on a regional and national level.",N/A,-1,-1
"The details of the rollout are admittedly a bit vague, but there s no denying the scale CurrentC could achieve when it s fully operational.",N/A,-1,-1
"MCX s membership runs 110,000 retail locations, including not just the aforementioned big box retailers, but also restaurants like the Olive Garden and Dunkin  Donuts, clothing merchants like the Gap, convenience stores like 7-Eleven and even airport and airline concession companies like HMSHost.",Gap,32,32
CurrentC is designed to be more than just a swipe-less smartphone payments method.,N/A,-1,-1
"According to MCX, it will be a repository for its members  loyalty cards and a means of distributing, storing and redeeming digital coupons and special offers.",N/A,-1,-1
CurrentC s functions will also integrate directly with MCX members  own mobile apps.,N/A,-1,-1
"What CurrentC doesn t do is support Near Field Communications, the contact-less transaction technology used by competing platforms Isis (which today renamed itself SoftCard) and Google Wallet.",N/A,-1,-1
"Instead, it will use digital QR codes generated by its smartphone app.",N/A,-1,-1
"Instead of storing credit card data in the phone itself, it will remain in the cloud and the smartphone app will generate a token that will verify the shopper s presence and identity and trigger the transaction between store and bank.",N/A,-1,-1
"The timing of the announcement may not be coincidence, given increasingly credible rumors indicate that Apple will launch its own NFC-based mobile payments system next week when it unveils the latest iteration of the iPhone.",N/A,-1,-1
"NFC has already begun penetrating deep into the Android ecosystem, but Apple has been one of the biggest obstacles to making smartphone contactless payments a reality.",N/A,-1,-1
"Even if the new iPhone does support NFC, that doesn t mean it will support MCX s CurrentC.",N/A,-1,-1
Carriers are already blocking alternative payment systems from their smartphones so they can t compete with their own Isis/SoftCard wallets.,N/A,-1,-1
"The mobile wallet space is becoming a very territorial one, and MCX appears to be engaging in the same turf war.",N/A,-1,-1
"MCX members like Best Buy are reportedly shutting down NFC capabilities at their payment terminals, clearing the way for their own digital wallets.",N/A,-1,-1
"In a ruling that could affect small businesses across the country, a California appeals court unanimously rejected claims by an auto body shop and an animal hospital, among others, that Yelp extorted them by tying positive and negative reviews to the purchase of advertising contracts worth $300 to $1,200 a month.",California,13,13
"On Tuesday, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found Yelp has the right to arrange its reviews, which let customers leave comments and a one-to-five star rating, as it it sees fit.",N/A,-1,-1
"The ruling, which also found Yelp has a right to engage in  hard bargaining,  agreed with a lower court s decision to throw out the case because the businesses had failed to make a claim that Yelp violated state or federal unfair competition law.",N/A,-1,-1
"The ruling is a clear victory for Yelp, which published a blog post on Friday describing the allegations as  conspiracy theories  and stating that Yelp has never altered  business ratings for money.",N/A,-1,-1
"The California businesses in the lawsuit had declared otherwise, stating that positive ratings disappeared or negative ones appeared on Yelp immediately after the business owners declined to purchase advertising contracts.",California,1,1
"One dentist in the case also claimed she finally agreed to sign up out of fear and that,  just days after signing the contract, her  overall rating increased to 4 stars and various five star reviews were reinstated by Yelp.",N/A,-1,-1
"While Yelp has always disavowed such allegations, the appeals court ruling will provide little comfort for other small business owners who believe their success depends on social media reviews.",N/A,-1,-1
"In particular, an important part of the decision   which does not ultimately resolve whether or not Yelp manipulates the reviews   explains that the company has the right to organize its website, and to sell ads, however it wishes to do so:

The court also expresses a concern about judges interfering with the normal course of business activity, and that a stricter rule  would transform a wide variety of legally acceptable business dealings into extortion.",N/A,-1,-1
"Yelp is hardly the only online review site   it competes with Google, among others   but the ruling may amount to a green light for all such review sites to employ what the court calls  hardball  sales tactics.",N/A,-1,-1
"For Yelp, the ruling is a partial vindication and a clear victory, but not the end of legal controversies tied to its business model.",N/A,-1,-1
"In August, a shareholder filed a class action suit claiming that Yelp withheld information about an FTC investigation over its negative review practices in order to goose its stock price.",N/A,-1,-1

"Samsung has announced the Gear VR, a virtual reality headset built to fit the new Galaxy Note 4 mobile phone.",N/A,-1,-1
"Gear VR can be controlled with an integrated touch pad, motion, voice or a gaming controller.",N/A,-1,-1
"Although it can use the phone s back-facing camera to combine the real world with the virtual, allowing for augmented reality applications, Samsung s focus with the Gear VR is to provide rich video experiences as opposed to interactivity.",N/A,-1,-1
Both the Gear VR and the Galaxy Note 4 were announced Wednesday.,N/A,-1,-1
"The price of the Gear VR, set to launch this fall, hasn t been announced.",N/A,-1,-1
"The headset is unusual for its close ties to Oculus, the Facebook-owned virtual reality forerunner that will likely release its headset sometime in the next year.",N/A,-1,-1
Samsung gave Oculus first dibs on its next-generation OLED screens in order to get early access to Oculus  software development kit.,N/A,-1,-1
"The Samsung device will feature a mix of Samsung and Oculus content, including four new Oculus applications known as Oculus Home, Oculus Cinema, Oculus 360 Videos and Oculus 360 Photos.",Home,21,21
"The project actually began as an experiment to see if great VR was possible on next-generation mobile hardware,  the Oculus team wrote in a blog post.",N/A,-1,-1
"Oculus CTO John Carmack and the mobile team at Oculus were able to blow everyone away in an extremely short amount of time, quickly proving that we were on to something special.",N/A,-1,-1
"The headset falls into a growing group of virtual reality devices that use a mobile phone instead of an embedded screen, such as the one found in Oculus Rift.",N/A,-1,-1
"As demonstrated by Google Cardboard, it s actually not that hard to adapt a mobile phone to provide a respectable virtual reality experience, but that doesn t diminish the fact that Samsung will be selling a mass-market VR product this fall, which will make high-quality virtual realty available to a significantly larger group of people than ever before.",N/A,-1,-1
"Given the number of developers that have been hard at work creating games and other applications for Oculus, this shot in the arm from Samsung could end up significantly expanding the content library.",N/A,-1,-1
"Samsung expanded its line of pen-enabled smartphones with a pair of new devices on Wednesday, announcing both the Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy Note Edge in Berlin with similar launch events taking place around the world.",Berlin,27,27
The former was expected as Samsung typically introduces a new Galaxy Note annually.,N/A,-1,-1
"The latter was more of a rumored long shot but it s the real deal, complete with a display on the side of the handset.",N/A,-1,-1
"The two Google Android 4.4 smartphones share a number of features, namely a high-resolution 2560 x 1440 screen, 2.7 GHz quad-core processor, 16 megapixel rear camera, 3.7 megapixel front camera, 3 GB of memory and a starting option of 32 GB for internal storage.",N/A,-1,-1
"Both of course, come with Samsung s S-Pen digital stylus and supporting apps such as Action Memo, Screen Write, Image Clip and Smart Select.",N/A,-1,-1
Samsung says it has improved the fingerprint sensor on the device as well.,N/A,-1,-1
"You d be hard-pressed to notice but the Galaxy Note 4 has a slightly larger display, measuring 5.7-inches diagonally.",N/A,-1,-1
The Galaxy Note Edge is 0.1-inches smaller but has the unique touchscreen along the right edge of the phone.,N/A,-1,-1
"With it, you can tap your most used application shortcuts for fast access.",N/A,-1,-1
"Notifications can also appear on the side screen, useful for when watching videos on the main display, Samsung says.",N/A,-1,-1
"Since this type of screen is new, I ll reserve judgement until after I use it.",N/A,-1,-1
It could prove valuable but I don t think it s the kind of thing you can praise or condemn until you give it a try.,N/A,-1,-1
"I ll give Samsung credit for the attempt no matter what: By using a curved design and secondary touch display, it shows the company is still willing to innovate and try new ideas.",N/A,-1,-1

"Asus officially introduced the ZenWatch, its first Android Wear smartwatch, on Wednesday.",N/A,-1,-1
The digital timepiece debuted at an Asus press event in Berlin during the IFA show and looks much like what we expected from leaked information over the past few weeks.,Berlin,10,10
"Image leaks, however, don t tell the whole story: It s clear Asus has spent some time adding its own features to this Android Wear device.",N/A,-1,-1
"As far as looks go, the Asus ZenWatch appears pretty stylish to me.",N/A,-1,-1
It has a curved 1.63-inch touch display with 320 x 320 resolution surrounded by stainless steel.,N/A,-1,-1
"The watch comes with a leather band and quick-release clasp; of course, you can swap out the band, as the ZenWatch accepts any 22-millimeter strap.",N/A,-1,-1
"All in all, this looks more like a watch than a device.",N/A,-1,-1
"Inside is a familiar package, as the ZenWatch has the same components as some other Google Android Wear smartwatches: A 1.2 GHz Snapdragon 400 chip, 512 MB of memory, 4 GB of storage, a microphone, 9-axis accelerometer and heart-rate monitor.",N/A,-1,-1
"The latter two sensors work with a companion Asus ZenUI Wellness app to track steps, calories, activity duration, level of exercise and relaxation.",N/A,-1,-1
That s just the first bit of software that Asus put some effort into as an attempt to stand out from the Android Wear crowd.,N/A,-1,-1
"Aside from its own included watch faces, Asus is presenting the ZenWatch as a strong companion to a Bluetooth-connected phone with these features: Watch Unlock, Tap Tap (a way to execute a custom task with a tap), Remote Camera, Cover to Mute, Find My Phone and Presentation Control.",N/A,-1,-1
"In Europe, the Asus ZenWatch will cost  199.",N/A,-1,-1

A subsidiary of German car giant Daimler has acquired two startupss   RideScout and myTaxi   that make mobile apps focused on transportation choices in cities.,N/A,-1,-1
"The move is part of Daimler s continued push beyond car manufacturing and into developing technology for urban mobility, as a next generation of city-dwellers is increasingly giving up on car ownership and opting for transportation alternatives from on-demand car services like Uber to car-sharing services like Zipcar.",N/A,-1,-1
"Daimler owns a mobility-focused subsidiary called moovel (formerly named Daimler Mobility Services), and under the moovel brand has operated a car-sharing network called car2go for a couple years now.",N/A,-1,-1
"Car2go has amassed 850,000 registered members across 26 cities, and the network enables its users to rent Smart Fortwo cars (made by Daimler) by the minute and hour.",N/A,-1,-1
Routine users of car2go like that a car can be picked up from one parking spot and left in another.,N/A,-1,-1
Most other car-sharing services require users to bring the cars back to their original parking spots.,N/A,-1,-1
The car2go network also includes some electric Smart ForTwos.,N/A,-1,-1
Car2go s North American arm has acquired the transportation app startup RideScout.,North,2,2
"RideScout, which launched an early version at SXSW last year, has created an app that enables users to discover transportation options from their location, choosing among buses, trains, carpools, car shares, bike shares, walking or just driving and parking.",N/A,-1,-1
"Daimler s moovel subsidiary has acquired myTaxi, a taxi-booking app that was launched in 2009 (and entered the U.S. in 2012), and which Daimler already had a 15 percent stake in.",N/A,-1,-1
myTaxi is made by the German startup Intelligent Apps.,N/A,-1,-1
"As Gigaom s David Meyer reported, myTaxi entered the U.S. with a trick up its sleeve: an integration between myTaxi and car2go.",N/A,-1,-1
And now presumably the integration will get even tighter.,N/A,-1,-1
"Many automakers have cautiously been exploring car sharing, ride sharing and alternative urban mobility.",Many,0,0
"As more people share cars and rides, fewer people will need to own cars, so that cuts into the bottom line of the car-selling business.",N/A,-1,-1
"As urban populations grow and driving and parking in cities becomes less attractive, car companies will need new ways to reach these car-free consumers.",N/A,-1,-1
"Rather than fight, the automakers are accepting that car sharing is part of a larger cultural shift in which consumers are less enamored with ownership and more enamored with services.",N/A,-1,-1
"And if car sharing truly becomes a widespread cultural phenomenon, the automotive companies best positioned in terms of car sharing will exert greater influence over what model of car consumers drive.",N/A,-1,-1
Want proof that the smart home is big  Check out the whopper private equity investment that KKR has made in Savant.,N/A,-1,-1
Savant said it has raised $90 million from its founder Robert Madonna and affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (KKR).,Robert,11,11
The round will help Savant navigate a space where it has played for years but is suddenly seeing an influx of competitors at both the low and high end.,N/A,-1,-1
Savant is a bit unusual in that it s designed for luxury homes and professional installers.,N/A,-1,-1
The company uses Apple hardware and has built software that models itself on Apple s ease of use and attractiveness.,N/A,-1,-1
Touches such as taking a picture of your living room and then programming that picture to act as the touch screen for your home controls are an example of how friendly the Savant experience is.,N/A,-1,-1
You just touch the lamp in your picture and it turns on.,N/A,-1,-1
It s fun.,N/A,-1,-1
In the last year Savant has taken its high-end ethos and moved closer to the DIY market with a cheaper product called the Savant Smart Series.,N/A,-1,-1
Instead of running on a Mac Mini it uses a Linux server stored in a closet or cabinet somewhere.,N/A,-1,-1
"That cheaper product will still run you around $1,600 for the basic set up.",N/A,-1,-1
In my previous conversations with Savant representatives they discussed adding support for more popular gadgets such as the Nest and Hue lights and also were playing around with conditional programming.,N/A,-1,-1
"On a visit to the Savant experience center in New York, I played around with the home and was impressed with how good the software was, although the experience was not really about adding any old connected devices, but a far more clean and curated experience.",York,10,10
"On a visit to the Savant experience center in New York, I played around with the home and was impressed with how good the software was, although the experience was not really about adding any old connected devices, but a far more clean and curated experience.",New York,9,10

"He and his successor, Brian Osavksy, who was VP of finance for Amazon s global consumer business, will work on a  seamless  transition over the next several months, according to a company statement on Wednesday.",N/A,-1,-1
"Szkutak joined Amazon in 2002 as CFO after serving in several capacities at General Electric, including as CFO of the company s lighting unit.",N/A,-1,-1
Since Amazon keeps its cards so close to the vest   just try asking how big Amazon Web Services is if you don t believe that   Szkutak s earnings call statements and other public pronouncements have been closely scrutinized.,N/A,-1,-1
"In the statement, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos sang Szkutak s praises:  Tom s impact over the past 12 years is evident in every part of our business.",N/A,-1,-1
"Under Tom s stewardship, customers have benefitted from category expansion and geographical expansion, along with amazing new businesses like AWS and Kindle. ",N/A,-1,-1
"Longtime data warehouse vendor Teradata appears to have found true big data religion, highlighted by the acquisition of consulting firm Think Big Analytics, which the two companies announced on Wednesday morning.",N/A,-1,-1
Think Big is a fairly well-known firm that rode the rise of Hadoop and NoSQL technologies and specializes in helping companies integrate them into their existing data architectures.,N/A,-1,-1
"The company, which has counted some big-name businesses among its clients since launching in 2010, will remain largely independent under Teradata s ownership.",N/A,-1,-1
"Ron Bodkin, Think Big s co-founder and CEO, said his company will still work on whatever technologies its clients have and desire, including competitive data warehouses.",N/A,-1,-1
It will not act as a replacement for the team of specialists who help Teradata customers deploy that technology.,N/A,-1,-1
"Our mission and focus at Think Big will continue,  Bodkin said.",N/A,-1,-1
"Rather, the acquisition seems like a greater acknowledgement by Teradata that being a one-trick company might not cut it over the long haul.",N/A,-1,-1
"Think Big is out there deploying potentially very large, complex infrastructure and Teradata, when it s involved, is just one component of it   albeit an often very large (and very expensive) one.",N/A,-1,-1
"Meanwhile, competitors such as Pivotal, IBM and Oracle are pushing entire collections of data-analytics systems, and even upstarts such as Cloudera are stepping on Teradata s turf with data warehouse options that are less capable but also offer lower costs for higher storage volumes.",Oracle,9,9
"Teradata has been addressing these concerns over the past few years, first by acquiring the MapReduce-based exploratory analytics startup Aster Data Systems in 2011, and then by partnering closely with Hadoop startup Hortonworks.",N/A,-1,-1
"The latter deal has led to new technologies for querying data across Teradata, Aster and Hadoop systems, and Teradata has rolled out its own white-label Hadoop appliances running the Hortonworks distribution.",N/A,-1,-1
"In October, Teradata said its platform would begin supporting JSON files, and the company announced an integration with MongoDB in June.",N/A,-1,-1
"In July, Teradata acquired Hadoop metadata management startup Revelytix, as well as (in what appears to have been a fire sale) the assets of SQL-on-Hadoop pioneer Hadapt.",N/A,-1,-1
(Analyst Curt Monash published some good insights on both deals at the time.,N/A,-1,-1
") Randy Lea, president of Teradata s big data practice, said the Revelytix deal already makes Teradata the best company for providing analytics and data management across such a wide range of systems.",N/A,-1,-1
He said Hadapt had  some very interesting technology and expertise  and that Teradata will talk more about its plans for that technology later.,N/A,-1,-1
One can imagine it adding some more native SQL options to its Hadoop appliance beyond what Apache Hive offers.,Apache,16,16
"Lea said Teradata is excited about Think Big for a number of reasons, including the intellectual property it has developed around certain big data pipelines and data science applications, and its training program for bringing employees up to speed on Hadoop, Storm, NoSQL and related technologies.",N/A,-1,-1
"Indeed, bolstering the Hadoop and open source expertise within Teradata itself would help the company better align and integrate its technologies with the other stuff customers want to use, letting it ride their respective wave without having to start peddling open source software.",N/A,-1,-1
"BI systems have encapsulated a very waterfall-like approach, where a large amount of design work must be done by technology professionals up front, before even simple business analysis can be done.",N/A,-1,-1
"While business users may have self-service tools for data discovery and visualization, how does that help with the process of sourcing and preparing the data to be analyzed 

An agile approach is needed, but not one that s sloppy.",N/A,-1,-1
"Pushing flat files into Hadoop may be tempting, but doing so has many of the same risks as storing lots of data in spreadsheets.",N/A,-1,-1
"What s needed is something that provides structure but then gets out of the way, to allow for creative analysis.",N/A,-1,-1
Between the waterfall approach of traditional BI and the entropy of  spreadmarts  and Hadoop lies a balanced approach.,N/A,-1,-1
"That s what s next for BI, and analytics in general.",N/A,-1,-1

Microsoft won t be able to blame high prices if it doesn t pick up some share of tablet sales over the coming months.,N/A,-1,-1
"Thanks to its no-cost Windows 8.1 with Bing licensing scheme, we re starting to see aggressively priced slates arriving on the market.",N/A,-1,-1
The latest is the $119 Toshiba Encore Mini.,N/A,-1,-1
Toshiba announced the device on Wednesday at Berlin s IFA event.,Berlin,7,7
"While the 7-inch slate has a manufacturer s suggested retail price of just under $120, it could be a $99 device on retail shelves, Toshiba told PC World.",N/A,-1,-1
"At this price, you have to keep your expectations in check, of course: No matter how much Microsoft discounts Windows, there s still the matter of hardware to be had.",N/A,-1,-1
"So some corners are cut compared to higher-priced, more capable tablets.",N/A,-1,-1
"For example, the 7-inch display is only 1024 x 600 resolution and it s not an IPS screen, meaning viewing angles will be compromised.",N/A,-1,-1
"While there s a quad-core Intel Atom chip inside, you ll have to make do with Windows running on just 1 GB of memory with a 16 GB flash drive for storage (you can expand the storage with a microSD card).",N/A,-1,-1
"And although the Encore Mini has a pair of cameras, that rear sensor is a scant 2 megapixel model.",N/A,-1,-1
"Still, it s impressive that a Microsoft hardware partner can bring the power of Windows 8.1 to the masses in a tablet priced around $100.",N/A,-1,-1
"Buyers could see this as a solid competitor to similarly priced or even slightly more expensive Google Android tablets, particularly because of additional incentives such as 1 terabyte of free OneDrive storage and an included one-year subscription to Microsoft Office 365.",N/A,-1,-1
"Concur Technologies is in talks to be acquired by ERP giant SAP, Bloomberg News reported late Tuesday.",N/A,-1,-1

It would make sense for Concur to try to cash in on the big enterprise software companies  buying binge   it provides SaaS-based expense report and travel management services for businesses.,N/A,-1,-1
"In the past year SAP, Oracle, Salesforce.com and others have bought up specialized point products to fill gaps in their business software portfolios.",Oracle,6,6

"Remember the U.K. s fast-tracked Data Retention and Investigatory Powers (DRIP) Act, which I and others were recently railing against  Well, here s a good example of why it s such a dangerous thing.",Powers,9,9
"DRIP, as you may recall, expands the kind of communications information that the police can requisition without a warrant, through an earlier piece of legislation known as the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, or RIPA.",Powers,34,34
"Whereas RIPA originally just allowed the cops to access call, SMS and ISP email records, it now means they can access metadata around webmail, chat rooms and anything that  consists in or includes facilitating the creation, management or storage of communications    as I have noted, everything is communications these days just by virtue of being online, so the potential scope granted to the authorities by DRIP is vast.",N/A,-1,-1

Cloud computing continues to play an increasingly important role for IT organizations in 2014.,N/A,-1,-1
"In partnership with Cloud Spectator, Gigaom Research conducted research to determine how three major cloud providers   Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure and Rackspace Cloud   perform with regards to processor and memory.",N/A,-1,-1
The three providers were tested using Geekbench 3 standardized tests over a three-day period of time.,N/A,-1,-1
Individual test results proved a variability of as much as 25 percent.,N/A,-1,-1
The complex of variables between cloud providers beyond just processor and memory can contribute heavily to this variability in results.,N/A,-1,-1
Tests were conducted over a three-day period to normalize the results.,N/A,-1,-1
"With each provider, different configurations of each solution were tested to demonstrate the variability and value between configurations.",N/A,-1,-1
"In addition, the provider s updated hardware configurations were used to ensure currency.",N/A,-1,-1
It should be noted that the tests in this research focused on the performance of processor and memory only.,N/A,-1,-1
"There are a number of other variables (network, architecture, etc) that can vary the results for a specific application or service.",N/A,-1,-1
Crowdfunding site Indiegogo has signed a partnership with smart home integrator Icontrol to create a program that will help select connected hardware companies featured on the site get Icontrol s help and eventual certification that their devices will work with Icontrol s OpenHome platform.,N/A,-1,-1
"Icontrol calls the program OpenHome Labs and says it s an incubator, although it seems less constrained by any sort of rigid time frame associated with an incubator program.",N/A,-1,-1
"However, it seems promising, and launches with three companies participating: Playtabase, Bttn and the Zen thermostat, which I wrote about last week and is pictured above.",N/A,-1,-1
"The idea is that the startups who want to work with Icontrol will apply and, if selected, will work with a team of mentors at OpenHome Labs who will help them with design, manufacturing, meeting partners and whatever else the young company needs.",N/A,-1,-1
"In return, the hardware startup must seek certification through iControl s OpenHome program after a successful crowdfunding.",N/A,-1,-1
That means the startup s device would work either with a Zigbee radio or via Wi-Fi with Icontrol s existing platform.,N/A,-1,-1
"In turn, they might find their product picked up for sale by a large cable provider or even tied to the Peq home hub system that is now sold in Best Buy stores.",N/A,-1,-1
"Jason Domangue, VP of Ecosystem Development with Icontrol, said that the company has a relationship and familiarity with Indiegogo companies  earlier this year it bought home security startup Piper, which had raised funds on Indiegogo.",N/A,-1,-1
"And with the current line up of launch partners, we might even see hints that Icontrol is going to move beyond Zigbee.",N/A,-1,-1
"Playtabase, which makes the Reemo gesture-based user interface system that I covered in May, relies on Bluetooth, while Bttn uses access to Wi-Fi and a cloud back end to offer people a programmable button that they can press to control aspects of their home.",N/A,-1,-1
"It s actually a neat device, because you can program it to do different things based on time of day or other cues.",N/A,-1,-1
"So it seems that while Icontrol is focused on Zigbee today, it s likely to branch out to other cloud services and radios.",N/A,-1,-1
Domangue agreed when I asked about supporting other popular devices like Hue lights or Nest.,N/A,-1,-1
"Many pundits view the internet of things as a decidedly grassroots phenomenon, where founders with bright ideas for a connected product ply their vision on crowdfunding sites and attract a mass market.",Many,0,0
"If this vision holds true, then Icontrol s plans make considerable sense.",N/A,-1,-1
I ve seen a gradual realization among larger companies in everything from semiconductors to large retailers that they should turn to crowdfunding to find the next big thing.,N/A,-1,-1
"So with this partnership and OpenHome Labs, Indiegogo gets to point startups toward a credible partner that they tap, while Icontrol gets to see the up-and-coming devices launching on Indiegogo.",N/A,-1,-1
"And for those who don t need crowdfunding, but are interested, Icontrol wants to hear from you too.",N/A,-1,-1

"The Chinese search giant Baidu has invested $10 million in IndoorAtlas, a Finland-based provider of geolocation technology.",N/A,-1,-1
"IndoorAtlas is an interesting outfit   it uses the Earth s geomagnetic field to establish the user s location, rather than just relying on wireless signals such as those from Wi-Fi routers, Bluetooth beacons or GPS satellites.",N/A,-1,-1

"Germany s Open-Xchange, a provider of web apps for renaming by service providers and deployment in the enterprise, has released an encryption tool called OX Guard.",N/A,-1,-1
"As around 110 million people use Open-Xchange s apps (though they probably don t know it), this is a reasonably big deal.",N/A,-1,-1
"OX Guard is designed to provide a layer of security over Open-Xchange s email and cloud storage products, whether they re consumed through a service provider or installed on the customer s own servers (the software is free for non-commercial use).",N/A,-1,-1
"The system encrypts email and file content with symmetric AES keys, then with RSA private/public key combinations.",N/A,-1,-1
"The idea is to make encryption simple for the end user, which is the holy grail of data security, as hard-to-use tools don t get used.",N/A,-1,-1
"And indeed, a demo of the service showed me that it s dead simple to deploy.",N/A,-1,-1
"When in the mail client, you just need to click a padlock logo and the email is sent encrypted.",N/A,-1,-1
"If the recipient isn t using an Open-Xchange client, they ll receive a link that opens up a guest account page, initially protected by a one-time passphrase.",N/A,-1,-1
"Messages can even be set to self-destruct, Snapchat-style.",N/A,-1,-1
"However, OX Guard doesn t really fix certain fundamental problems that bedevil the PGP security system   the ones to do with key management.",N/A,-1,-1
"Using OX Guard is simple because the user doesn t need to deal with encryption keys, and that only works because key management takes place on the server side.",N/A,-1,-1
That means you need to trust whoever is running the server not to offer up or expose your private key.,N/A,-1,-1
"According to Open-Xchange CEO Rafael Laguna, that s OK because people can move their account between providers   you can even run it on your own server, though that takes a fair amount of technical know-how.",Laguna,5,5
"As he told me:

It s certainly better than no encryption, but still far from ideal.",N/A,-1,-1
"Additionally, if you re communicating with someone who s not using Open-Xchange apps, the one-time passphrase also needs to be sent somehow.",N/A,-1,-1
"By default, it will be sent in a separate email   not much use if you re worried about someone intercepting your traffic.",N/A,-1,-1
"The best option here would probably be to send the passphrase by some other means, such as dictating it over the phone.",N/A,-1,-1
"I don t mean to criticize Open-Xchange in particular here   the same problem applies to others playing in this space, such as Tutanota, who are also dealing with the complexities of adding security to a universal protocol that s implemented across fragmented platforms.",N/A,-1,-1
"I think it s just a case where users should be aware of the limitations of the security they re adopting, and take this into account when they re weighing up risk.",N/A,-1,-1
"For most people, having some security is certainly better than none, and making it easy to use is essential.",N/A,-1,-1
"For that, Open-Xchange should be commended.",N/A,-1,-1
Also in OX Guard s favor is the fact that it is open source and can be freely audited.,N/A,-1,-1
"For those who are interested, the system uses Bouncy Castle APIs for the PGP stuff and Java Crypto for AES and RSA encryption.",N/A,-1,-1

Almost everyone outside of IBM s executive suite now agrees that the goal of hitting $20 earnings per share by 2015 did more harm than good.,N/A,-1,-1
"In its attempt to get to that magic number   promised by former CEO Sam Palmisano in 2010   IBM has laid off thousands of employees and sold or attempted to sell off less profitable businesses, in moves seen by many as counterproductive for the long haul.",N/A,-1,-1
"On Tuesday, UBS analyst Steve Milunovich said these long-term projections are not worth doing in this era of tech realignment and that IBM needs to focus on long-term strategy instead of EPS goals.",N/A,-1,-1
"IBM s trailing twelve month EPS is $14.85, so it has a tough row to hoe between now and the end of its fiscal 2015, which would be Dec. 31, 2016.",N/A,-1,-1
"We advocate guidance that does not target a long-term EPS number,  Milunovich wrote in a research note released Tuesday morning.",N/A,-1,-1
"We think IBM should (1) give annual and perhaps next quarter earnings and cash flow guidance but not beyond; (2) build on the analyst meeting by providing consistent metrics round three segments: strategic imperatives, recurring core franchises, and transacaitonal businesses; (3) provide more detail on the overall financial impact of cloud and Big Data on financials.",N/A,-1,-1
IBM should also think about using its cash to pay dividends rather than share buybacks and (shock) emphasize long-term principals  margin over revenue     he noted.,N/A,-1,-1
"For the record, Milunovich himself thinks IBM will hit the target, but the question is what it has to do to make that happen.",N/A,-1,-1
"If it makes the number but only because of low tax rates and layoffs etc., what does it really mean

There won t be many people surprised if Google launches a new Nexus tablet when it debuts its Android L software later this year.,N/A,-1,-1
Google has used its Nexus 7 to showcase Android 4.2 and 4.3.,N/A,-1,-1
"What it hasn t done, however, is created a small keyboard attachment for its tablets.",N/A,-1,-1
That appears to be at least one change coming with the widely expected Nexus 9 slate.,N/A,-1,-1
"Android Police is confirming a weekend tweet from @upleaks, which said the Nexus 9 would have several choices of official cases including one with a keyboard option:

The covers aren t anything new; Google previously offered a case attachment for the Nexus 7.",N/A,-1,-1
The keyboard folio would be new and likely a more feasible option for a 9-inch tablet as opposed to the currently available smaller 7-inch model.,N/A,-1,-1
Android Police shared the following image to show what the folio attachment may look like.,N/A,-1,-1
"The case design appears similar to the official Apple iPad Smart Case, complete with triple-folding cover that doubles as a stand.",N/A,-1,-1
"Unlike Apple s iPad accessory, however, Google s is expected to have a full hardware keyboard.",N/A,-1,-1
"Although it s not shown in the design image, it s likely the Nexus 9 tablet would sit in the middle hinge; either in a slot or perhaps with magnets.",N/A,-1,-1
"The micro USB port on the side of the hinge suggests an internal battery, which would be used to power a Bluetooth radio says Android Police.",N/A,-1,-1
Another reason that a keyboard such as this may not have made as much sense for the Nexus 7 is that tablet s 16:10 aspect ratio.,N/A,-1,-1
It s a very wide device in landscape mode when you d want to use a keyboard but there s not much vertical working room.,N/A,-1,-1
"The case suggests a 4:3 aspect ratio for the Nexus 9, which would provide a better workspace for productivity apps that might require a keyboard.",N/A,-1,-1
"That s not to say the Nexus 9 won t make for a good consumption device like the Nexus 7, but if Google is going to boost the screen size, it makes sense to give consumers a reason to do so.",N/A,-1,-1

The experience of using Instagram s new steadycam time-lapse video app Hyperlapse is about the polar opposite of the complexity that s going on under the surface of the app.,N/A,-1,-1

But the Hyperlapse UI itself is utter simplicity.,N/A,-1,-1
"The first screen only has a record button, and after recording, the only option is choosing the speed of your video.",N/A,-1,-1
"The last step, of course, is to share it.",N/A,-1,-1

"HP hasn t dabbled much in the small Windows tablet market, instead opting to use Google Android for prior slates.",N/A,-1,-1

"The display resolution is 1280 x 800 and while there s a camera shown on the rear of the device, there s no indication of a front-facing image sensor.",N/A,-1,-1
"According to Liliputing, which spotted the Mobile Geeks post, the HP Stream 7 retail price is expected to be  179.",Mobile,7,7

"Also, contacts sync is working along with better suspend/resume handling, and a bunch of other smaller things.",N/A,-1,-1
"More importantly, the LuneOS team added a way for the software to receive updates instead of requiring users to erase their devices and fully reinstall new versions of the software.",N/A,-1,-1
"With today s mobile landscape dominated by Google Android and Apple iOS, LuneOS has practically no chance to become much more than an enthusiast project.",N/A,-1,-1
That s not meant to diminish the team s effort; I still have a TouchPad and always thought the webOS interface was outstanding.,N/A,-1,-1

"And to make that network go even further, Sonos is also introducing its very first Wi-Fi range extender, dubbed the Boost.",N/A,-1,-1
"That s a departure from the way Sonos has traditionally streamed music across the home: Ever since it launched its first product in 2005, Sonos required users to bypass their home Wi-Fi network, either by directly plugging into a router with an ethernet cable or with the company s own Bridge device, which operates its own dedicated wireless network optimized for audio streaming.",N/A,-1,-1
"We were paranoid about the quality of the networking,  remembered Andy Schulert, Sonos VP of quality.",N/A,-1,-1
"In hindsight, that was the right decision in 2003,  when the company started working on its first products, and Wi-Fi routers still were riddled with problems, he said.",N/A,-1,-1
"However, Wi-Fi has evolved over the last decade, and most consumers nowadays have routers that easily cover their entire home.",N/A,-1,-1
"Plus, Sonos isn t the only application requiring connectivity and quality of service for media streaming anymore.",N/A,-1,-1
"People use Netflix and YouTube all over their house, and frequently upgrade their routers when their home network isn t capable of accessing these services, optimizing network performance for Sonos speakers in the process.",N/A,-1,-1
"Sonos has been working on switching from its proprietary network to open Wi-Fi for about two years, and during recent months tested Bridge-less setups with thousands of customers and close to 400 different home Wi-Fi routers.",N/A,-1,-1
"Schulert said he feels confident that the company s speakers will work on home Wi-Fi in most cases, in part because Sonos speakers still use their own mesh technology in multi-room setups.",N/A,-1,-1
"If you have one Sonos speaker in your living room and one in your kitchen, then only one of them will access Spotify through your router, and then relay the signal to the other one, provided both are within reach.",N/A,-1,-1
"Of course, sometimes, that s simply not the case.",N/A,-1,-1
That s why Sonos will launch a kind of specialized range extender called the Boost for $99 later this year that will use the company s proprietary wireless networking technology to reach every last corner of your house.,N/A,-1,-1
"And Sonos will continue to sell the $49 Bridge as well, as the device is still required for 3.1 or 5.1 home theater set-ups.",N/A,-1,-1
"For Sonos, switching to regular Wi-Fi is all about making things easier for new customers.",N/A,-1,-1
"The Bridge requirement  was a little bit of a speed bump,  said Schulert, even though retailers frequently bundled the device as part of special promotions.",N/A,-1,-1
"Now, consumers will be able to buy a speaker and get started without a bridge or an ethernet cable, which should help the company during the coming holiday season.",N/A,-1,-1
What does all of this mean for existing customers  Sonos actually wants them to keep their Bridges plugged in.,N/A,-1,-1
"Don t change a thing,  Schulert told me.",N/A,-1,-1
"He added that it s possible to switch existing systems to a Bridge-less setup, but the company would rather people stick with what s already working.",N/A,-1,-1
"That s understandable from a customer support perspective; after all, changing a working setup can possibly introduce new points of failure   but as a Sonos user myself, I have to say that I can t wait to get rid of my Bridge.",N/A,-1,-1

"For Overstock, there was no  deep strategy  to roll it out to international consumers, said CEO Patrick Byrne.",N/A,-1,-1
"Instead, it was about the distribution of resources needed to implement it.",N/A,-1,-1
"Bitcoin payments currently account for one quarter of one percent of Overstock s daily transactions, Byrne said, so the company was limited by how many resources it could dedicate to the project during its development cycle.",N/A,-1,-1
(The) U.S. is a bigger share of our business.,N/A,-1,-1

"The  generous  approximation of four percent savings will be donated to a different bitcoin charity or foundation around the world each month, starting with the Chamber of Digital Commerce.",Commerce,29,29

"A high-level European Union report has recommended forcing broadcasters to stop using 700MHz spectrum by 2020, so the airwaves can be freed up for wireless broadband.",Union,3,3
"These particular airwaves are great for connectivity   with radio spectrum, the lower the number, the better it is at propagating transmissions over great distances and into buildings.",N/A,-1,-1
"That s why, over in the U.S., T-Mobile shelled out $2.6 billion for some of Verizon s 700MHz holdings at the start of this year.",Mobile,10,10
"In Europe, 700MHz (really 694-790MHz) is still largely reserved for TV broadcasts and wireless microphones, as is most other UHF spectrum.",N/A,-1,-1
"However, the Monday report by Pascal Lamy, a former trade commissioner and WTO chief, said it should be reserved for wireless broadband by 2020   give or take two years.",N/A,-1,-1
This would allow a more harmonized approach to 700MHz across what is supposed to be a single market.,N/A,-1,-1
"Currently, countries such as Germany, Finland and Sweden are keen to steam ahead with using 700MHz for broadband, but that would lead to fragmentation and make life difficult for device manufacturers.",N/A,-1,-1
"As a sop to the broadcasters, Lamy recommended that they be able to continue using the UHF spectrum below 700MHz (i.e.",N/A,-1,-1
470-694MHz) until 2030.,N/A,-1,-1
"This would mean Europe defending these airwaves for broadcasters when it comes to global discussions, though the Commission said on Monday that  some flexibility could nevertheless be catered for through the development of  down link only  technologies that give priority to primary broadcasting networks.",N/A,-1,-1
"Additionally, there would need to be a full review of all UHF spectrum in Europe by 2025, Lamy recommended.",N/A,-1,-1
For too long the broadband and broadcasting communities have been at loggerheads about the use of the UHF spectrum band.,N/A,-1,-1
There have been many different views and perspectives.,N/A,-1,-1
"On the basis of discussions with the two sectors, I have put forward a single scheme that could provide a way forward for Europe to thrive in the digital century,  Lamy said in a statement.",N/A,-1,-1

"It was supposed to be the product of a high-level group of industry stakeholders, but it ended up having just Lamy s name on it   the group couldn t agree a compromise.",N/A,-1,-1
"If the Commission goes ahead with Lamy s recommendations (they re still waiting on a separate report from the member states) then the broadcasters will lose 30 percent of their spectrum holdings, and will be forced to use more efficient compression and transmission technologies.",N/A,-1,-1
"The Commission reckons this would allow traditional broadcast operations to continue, while providing space for the explosion in demand for mobile data.",N/A,-1,-1
"Still, the carriers aren t entirely happy with Lamy s report.",N/A,-1,-1

SK Telecom is working with eel farmers in its native South Korea to develop a system of wirelessly connected water sensors that can be monitored and managed from a smartphone.,N/A,-1,-1
"The first pilot of the IoT aquaculture management system is being tested on an eel farm in Gochang, South Korea this month.",N/A,-1,-1
"A set of sensors in dozens of 20-foot-wide eel tanks wirelessly transmit data on water temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen levels to a sensor hub (in fact, the system probably works similarly to your smart home), which in turn connects to SK Telecom s LTE network using a machine-to-machine radio.",N/A,-1,-1
"That data is sent to Mobius, a cloud platform developed by SK Telecom for consumer and industrial internet of things apps.",N/A,-1,-1
Mobius then routes that data to an aquaculture management server for analysis and to a smartphone app where the eel farmer can monitor the sensors in real time.,N/A,-1,-1
"Apparently eel farming is a tricky business as even a small change in temperature, oxygen level or acidity in the water can be fatal to juvenile eels in a matter of hours.",N/A,-1,-1
"According to SKT, eel farms typically solve this problem with manpower: farmers manually check their water sensors at two to six hour intervals and then make the necessary adjustments to the tanks.",N/A,-1,-1
"With the aquaculture IoT system in place though, that process is largely automated.",N/A,-1,-1
"If a sudden change is detected in the middle of the night that could result in eel carnage, the fish tank management servers in the cloud immediately notify the farmer through smartphone alerts.",N/A,-1,-1
"The internet of things has already expanded into many parts of the agricultural world, from wine vineyards to dairies.",N/A,-1,-1

The Apple event rumors are coalescing into a more coherent picture that indicate Apple planning to put Near Field Communication chips inside next-generation iPhones for a mobile wallet effort.,N/A,-1,-1
"The latest rumor is from Bloomberg, which quotes a source saying that the hardware giant is working with MasterCard, Visa and American Express on a payments platform around the NFC chip reported to be in the phone.",N/A,-1,-1
"The goal, according to Bloomberg is to ready a mobile payments platform built around NFC in the upcoming iPhone to launch at the Sept. 9 Apple event.",N/A,-1,-1
"While, every year, we seemingly hear of NFC launching in the anticipated iPhone, my colleague Kevin Tofel has written about how the looming transition to higher security payments that require using a password and chip inside cards in the U.S., and the utility of NFC s tap-to-pair in a world of increasing connected devices, mean that Apple may finally be ready to take on NFC.",N/A,-1,-1
"From his story:

With such clout, I wouldn t be surprised if Apple has had discussions with the major credit card payment processing companies to help steer the direction of advanced mobile payments and the terminals required for them.",N/A,-1,-1
"Note too that NFC and EMV can work hand-in-hand to provide a contactless, more secure payment transaction.",N/A,-1,-1
There s more to NFC than payments though.,N/A,-1,-1
An oft-overlooked use of NFC is tap to pair.,N/A,-1,-1
"This is super useful when pairing two devices over a wireless connection, such as Bluetooth.",N/A,-1,-1
"It s great for pairing wireless headphones or speakers to a phone, for example.",N/A,-1,-1
"And wouldn t it be helpful to pair, say a wearable device, with your iPhone; perhaps an iWatch, which is also widely expected on September 9 

As a radio technology, NFC allows two objects that are close to each other to securely exchange information.",N/A,-1,-1
It s a common radio used in MasterCard s PayPass and in the fobs employees use to get into office buildings.,N/A,-1,-1
"Currently, select Android phones use NFC for the Google Wallet and carriers  Isis payments effort.",N/A,-1,-1
"Yes, so far, none of these or other mobile payments efforts have taken off, in part because the mobile ecosystem is fragment and because everyone involved wants a piece of the revenue from processing mobile payments.",N/A,-1,-1
"The payments industry relies on merchants to implement the proper equipment for accepting credit cards or NFC-radios, while banks have to work with the card companies to issue cards with the appropriate technology.",N/A,-1,-1
They also have to handle the complex fraud-detection and guarantees associated with credit cards.,N/A,-1,-1
"For this, they and the payments processors like Mastercard and Visa charge a fee to merchants.",N/A,-1,-1
"But with mobile payments, new players entered this established regime in the form of the carriers and the big mobile OS providers, Google and Apple.",N/A,-1,-1
And each of the parties involved want their own cut of the revenue.,N/A,-1,-1
"This has meant that we have lots of options, but nothing universal, so many merchants aren t inspired to upgrade their payment acceptance systems to support mobile payments.",N/A,-1,-1
Apple deploying NFC could help create the standard that the industry needs to get merchants to deploy more NFC terminals.,N/A,-1,-1
"Since many merchants are upgrading their current card infrastructure ahead of the Oct. 2015 deadline to accept more secure password and chip technology, the payments processors and Apple may realize that a tiny nudge could set NFC to become the de facto mobile payments standard.",N/A,-1,-1
"After over a decade, it may be now or never to get a good mobile payments standard set.",N/A,-1,-1
"When we talk about the future of artificial intelligence (AI), the discussion often focuses on the advancements and capabilities of the technology, or even the risks and opportunities inherent in the potential cultural implications.",N/A,-1,-1
"What we frequently overlook, however, is the future of AI as a business.",N/A,-1,-1
"IBM Watson s recent acquisition and deployment of Cognea signals an important shift in the AI and intelligent virtual assistant (IVA) market, and offers an indication of both of the potentials of AI as a business and the areas where the market still needs development.",N/A,-1,-1
The AI business is about to be transformed by consolidation.,N/A,-1,-1
"Consolidation carries real risks, but it is generally a sign of technological maturation.",N/A,-1,-1
"And it s about time, as AI is no longer simply a side project, or an R&D euphemism.",N/A,-1,-1
AI is finally center stage.,N/A,-1,-1
"IBM, for all its investment in the Watson platform, was still missing, among other elements, the  personality    a critical piece of the virtual assistant puzzle.",N/A,-1,-1
"IBM is betting big on Watson overall, to the tune of $1 billion, and is therefore addressing Watson s weaknesses aggressively.",N/A,-1,-1
Assembling the complete puzzle is a non-trivial technological challenge and I m not at all surprised IBM snapped up Cognea.,N/A,-1,-1
"One of the companies I advise, Next IT, has gone to great lengths to create IVA s with fully-developed personas   ranging from SGT STAR for the U.S. Army to Aetna s Ann.",N/A,-1,-1
"These IVAs have a tone, a personality, a sense of humor and a vernacular custom-suited to their use cases.",N/A,-1,-1
"But even those personalities required proficiency in other facets of the technology, such as an expertly developed domain model.",N/A,-1,-1
"If you chat with the above examples, you ll see how the two pieces interact very differently.",N/A,-1,-1
"Because intelligent virtual assistants are focused within a domain model, they benefit from a clearly defined knowledge base and are able to go much deeper and stay within those bounds, whereas general purpose assistants like Apple s Siri are often asked to deal with users  wide-ranging and often disorganized goals.",N/A,-1,-1
"This is yet another argument for consolidation   building and implementing a cross-domain view of the world is a challenge, very likely bigger than any single company or customer.",N/A,-1,-1
"We likely won t have  one assistant to rule them all,  but rather a team of assistants, each aware of its strengths and weaknesses, always collaborating in the background, delegating and stratifying based on the task at hand.",N/A,-1,-1
Personality is just one example of a shortcoming being addressed.,N/A,-1,-1
"So-called  best of breed  capabilities are scattered all over, and right now the AI market has a lot of niches.",N/A,-1,-1
Natural language processing is important; machine learning   both statistical and symbolic   is important; domain models and ontologies are important; reasoning is important.,N/A,-1,-1
The list goes on.,N/A,-1,-1
"These disparate focuses inherently mean most IVAs are incomplete   they ve either gone to college and have weak people skills, or they skipped college altogether and have some street smarts but little else.",N/A,-1,-1
They either partied too much or spent too much time in the lab.,N/A,-1,-1

Moving from proof of concept (POC) to production is a significant step for big data workloads.,N/A,-1,-1
Scaling Hadoop jobs is fraught with challenges.,N/A,-1,-1
Sometimes large jobs just won t finish.,N/A,-1,-1
A job that ran in testing won t run at production scale.,N/A,-1,-1
Data can also be an issue: the POC often uses unrealistically small or uniform datasets.,N/A,-1,-1

"As comfortable margins start to erode, add capacity or optimize your applications to keep pace.",N/A,-1,-1
"Adjust your capacity-planning model, with particular attention on worst-case performance, so that it matches what you re seeing in reality.",N/A,-1,-1
Another symptom of impending crisis is shrinking data retention windows.,N/A,-1,-1
"Initially, you hoped to keep 13 months of data for year-over-year analysis.",N/A,-1,-1
"Because of space constraints, you find yourself cutting that number.",N/A,-1,-1
"At some point, you lose the ability to do the type of big data analysis that justified your Hadoop investment to begin with.",N/A,-1,-1
Shrinking retention windows are the storage equivalent of missed deadlines.,N/A,-1,-1
The dynamic is also the same: a margin that initially seems comfortable becomes  just enough  and then  not enough.,N/A,-1,-1
Act early.,N/A,-1,-1
"As margins erode, revisit your capacity models to see why your predictions didn t hold, and adjust to better track what s happening.",N/A,-1,-1
An over-utilized Hadoop cluster can stifle innovation.,N/A,-1,-1
There s not enough compute capacity for data scientists to launch large jobs.,N/A,-1,-1
"There s insufficient space for them to store large, intermediate results.",N/A,-1,-1
Capacity planning routinely omits or underestimates the needs of data scientists.,N/A,-1,-1
"That omission, compounded with inadequate planning for production work, means the needs of data scientists often become marginalized.",N/A,-1,-1

But good capacity planning is just the start.,N/A,-1,-1
"If you plan on growing an IaaS-based Hadoop implementation, expect to invest heavily in systems to track and optimize costs, as Netflix has done.",N/A,-1,-1
Hadoop plans typically underestimate the effort required to keep a Hadoop cluster running smoothly.,N/A,-1,-1
It s an understandable miscalculation.,N/A,-1,-1
"With classic enterprise applications, the initial implementation effort is orders of magnitude larger than ongoing maintenance and support.",N/A,-1,-1
"People assume Hadoop follows a similar pattern, but it doesn t. Hadoop gets harder to maintain as it scales, and it requires a lot of work from your ops team.",N/A,-1,-1
Good capacity planning is essential to promote sanity.,N/A,-1,-1

Some of this is such a device is outside of my budget.,N/A,-1,-1
"I could probably afford $99 for an Apple version of a Fitbit, but not much more than that.",N/A,-1,-1
I also don t really want a device that lights up when I m working with a notification.,N/A,-1,-1

"For the sake of fun, though, let s pretend a 12.9-inch iPad really is a product Apple would release.",N/A,-1,-1
iPad sales have been consistently down for a few quarters.,N/A,-1,-1
My feeling is this is because upgrade cycles for iPads are longer than the iPhone.,N/A,-1,-1

"The Form 1+, which was released in June by Cambridge startup Formlabs, is one of the most beautiful printers ever built.",Cambridge,10,10
"It s also one of the most functional and reliable, and over three weeks of testing I found it to be a great choice for an advanced consumer 3D printer.",N/A,-1,-1
"The $3,299 Form 1+ is the successor to Formlabs  first printer, the Form 1, and actually doesn t look very different.",N/A,-1,-1
But it is designed to print up to 50 percent faster than the Form 1 with a laser that is four times more powerful.,N/A,-1,-1
"What s a laser doing in a 3D printer  Well, the Form 1+ isn t the same type of printer as a MakerBot or most other desktop machines, which rely on a technology known as fused deposition modeling (FDM).",N/A,-1,-1
"It s a stereolithographic (SLA) 3D printer; that means instead of melting plastic and then allowing it to harden, it uses a liquid plastic resin as its  ink.",N/A,-1,-1

It just worked the first 3D printer to ever do so for me.,N/A,-1,-1
The print jobs that did fail seemed to be my fault; I picked a design that was too tricky or didn t clean the resin tank thoroughly.,N/A,-1,-1
The Form 1+ s biggest strength is the quality of prints it puts out.,N/A,-1,-1
It is capable of printing layers of plastic just 25 microns thick a quarter of the width of a piece of human hair.,N/A,-1,-1
That s four times finer detail than the 100-micron layers MakerBot s fifth generation Replicator is capable of printing.,N/A,-1,-1

"Still, the Form 1+ shares the same weaknesses as any SLA printer.",N/A,-1,-1
"It can be messy to use, as you constantly have to deal with the liquid resin it uses to print.",N/A,-1,-1
"After a part comes out of the printer, it needs to be soaked in rubbing alcohol to get off the excess resin.",N/A,-1,-1
Then the supports have to be clipped off.,N/A,-1,-1
"This tends to leave ugly plastic nubs where the supports were attached, which can only be removed with sanding.",N/A,-1,-1
It s a headache.,N/A,-1,-1
The printer is also missing some premium features that are becoming more common among newer printers.,N/A,-1,-1
"It doesn t include a camera for viewing a print job s process from afar, which would be useful considering it can easily take eight or even 24 hours to print objects on the Form 1+.",N/A,-1,-1

A previous version of this story included incorrect information about pricing of reserved instances and incorrectly stated that AWS had raised its prices in April.,N/A,-1,-1
Amazon Web Services has become well-known for its price cuts   it s announced 45 of them over the last eight years.,N/A,-1,-1
"And often, the cuts are substantial: For example, AWS announced price cuts as high as 56 percent effective April 1, 2014.",N/A,-1,-1
"It s not just Amazon that is making massive price cuts: in the first half of this year, we saw a raft of price cuts from Google and Microsoft Azure, too.",N/A,-1,-1
The cloud pricing world is beginning to look a lot like the airline ticket pricing world where cuts by one airline are quickly matched by another airline.,N/A,-1,-1
"But as any traveler knows, while airlines may cut some prices, they also raise others, adding baggage fees or charging higher prices for travel at peak times times.",N/A,-1,-1
All this means the customer may not actually see the advertised fare reductions in normal usage.,N/A,-1,-1
Guess what   a similar thing occurs in the cloud pricing space.,N/A,-1,-1
"Despite the advertised price cuts by AWS, consumers might not actually see that level of reductions in their bills.",N/A,-1,-1
"Price reductions are usually on specific configurations and offerings, not necessarily what customers typically use (not unlike the  sales  you see at department stores to get shoppers in the door).",Price,0,0
"And while AWS cut prices on several services in April, it also kept prices of some services   such as data transfer and certain flavors of reserved instances   the same.",N/A,-1,-1
"Here s an example of specific Reserved Instance changes:

In the same time period, AWS changed its discount table, reducing the discount on Reserved Instances:

The combination of price cuts and changes in the discount table will result in a net price cut that could be different than what you might expect.",N/A,-1,-1
A typical customer will use a mix of services.,N/A,-1,-1
"Some of them will be impacted by price reductions and others won t. Because of this, it s important for cloud customers to take a close look at what they ll actually be paying for their full set of services.",N/A,-1,-1
"The public cloud providers   all of them, not just AWS   aren t particularly clear about the narrow applicability of certain price cuts, and certainly don t advertise price increases the way they do price cuts.",N/A,-1,-1
It s really hard to figure this out because public cloud pricing from any provider and the subsequent billing is so complex that it s near impossible to understand how the amazing and loudly broadcast price cuts translate into an actual benefit for you.,N/A,-1,-1
We encourage cloud consumers to more diligently analyze their cloud bills and to compare different cloud providers at more than just a surface level (e.g.,N/A,-1,-1

"The skeptics might have a point: in a withering investigative report this week, the Center for Public Integrity described a pattern in which AT&T and others browbeat local utilities into halting projects intended to give residents better internet.",Center,16,16
"The pattern involves spending heavily on state-level lobbying, threatening towns with expensive lawsuits and leaning on politicians to pass laws that handcuff local utilities.",N/A,-1,-1

FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has left no doubt about what he thinks the answer should be: he has stated publicly that cities like Chattanooga should be able to build out their own broadband powers if they so choose.,Chattanooga,24,24
"In particular, he has also used one word    preempt    that represents a legal dagger aimed at the state laws.",N/A,-1,-1
"Wheeler s word choice stands for the idea of  preemption,  a concept expressed in the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution that, simply put, means the federal government can sweep aside state laws under certain circumstances.",Wheeler,0,0
"In some cases, like copyright or immigration, the federal preemption power is unambiguous, but in others it is not.",N/A,-1,-1
The FCC s right to overrule state telecoms law is one example of an area in which the federal preemption power is unclear.,N/A,-1,-1
"In 1996, for instance, the Supreme Court held 8-1 that the FCC was right to refuse to invoke powers of pre-emption to strike down a Missouri law that barred local governments from offering telecommunications services (see Todd Giffen s remarks in the comments below).",Missouri,27,27
"This time around, the public utilities and their supporters claim the FCC can use a different source of authority than the one it unsuccessfully relied upon in the Missouri case.",Missouri,29,29
"Specifically, they point to Section 706 of the Communications Act, which instructs the agency to promote broadband adoption, in part by removing obstacles to infrastructure investment.",N/A,-1,-1
"So what s the legal issue  As it turns out, the public utilities  argument for FCC power turns on the meaning of a four-word phrase:  or other regulating methods.",N/A,-1,-1

"One thing that is clear is that what is generally referred to as a smartphone is overtaking the category of feature phones all around the globe, achieving 57.6 of total mobile phone sales in the fourth quarter of 2013 according to Gartner.",N/A,-1,-1
A popular way of identifying a smartphone is whether or not you can install an app on it.,N/A,-1,-1
That perception is somewhat rooted in reality is when you look at IDC s Worldwide Market Data.,N/A,-1,-1
The worldwide smartphone market grew 25.3 percent year over year in the second quarter of 2014 with over 300 million smartphones shipped in that quarter.,N/A,-1,-1
More than 96 percent of those shipments were either an Android (87.4 percent) or iPhone (11.7 percent) smartphone.,N/A,-1,-1
That leaves just 3.6 percent of the market to all other smartphone platforms including Microsoft (2.5 percent) and Blackberry (0.5 percent).,N/A,-1,-1
Something to keep in mind is that not all smartphones are available in all markets around the world.,N/A,-1,-1
"In fact, some of the fastest growing smartphone markets are being dominated by manufactures that are not as well known here in the U.S.

Take Huawei as an example.",N/A,-1,-1
"As Samsung s marketshare decreased from 32.2 percent in 2013 to 24.9 percent in 2014, Huawei s market share grew from 4.3 percent to 6.7 percent, beating out both Lenovo and LG for third place.",N/A,-1,-1
"Huawei is planning on continued growth this year, increasing shipments from 52 million last year to 80 million units in 2014.",N/A,-1,-1
"Although it measures worldwide data, IDC s data tracks shipments instead of sales.",N/A,-1,-1
And even sales numbers are not necessarily the best data points to use when trying to figure out what devices people are actually using.,N/A,-1,-1
"In fact, OnePoll updated its annual survey for SellCell.com earlier this year and concluded that there approximately $47 billion worth of unused cell phones in consumers  hands this year, which is up from $34 billion last year.",N/A,-1,-1

"While this data paints a very different picture compared to the worldwide numbers offered by IDC, there is one major similarity: the combined market share for both iOS and Android is 94 percent.",N/A,-1,-1

"As you can tell, you don t have to be a massive financial institution or a government agency to be at risk.",N/A,-1,-1
"That being said, there are some steps you can take to protect your business, and while these tips may seem pretty obvious, sometimes you just need a nagging reminder that security is a process.",N/A,-1,-1
"Security tends to follow the 80/20 rule, in which the majority of potential threats a company might face are relatively harmless but the ones that aren t pose huge risks, said OpenDNS CEO David Ulevitch.",N/A,-1,-1
"In order to concentrate on the big security threats, you need to remove the excess noise and that can be done by educating your staff on common security lapses.",N/A,-1,-1
Here s an easy security tip you can pass along to mitigate the noise: Don t click on shady-looking emails that have nothing to do with your work.,N/A,-1,-1
"These emails are most likely part of phishing scams, in which malicious links are embedded within crafty messages tailored to like legitimate emails.",N/A,-1,-1
"Orion Hindawi, the co-founder and CTO of Tanium, said most of the attacks his company has been seeing comes from instances in which someone gives their password away when clicking through a misleading email that asks them for private information.",N/A,-1,-1
"Pictures of cute bunnies are probably not something you should be clicking on at work,  said Hindawi.",N/A,-1,-1
"Of course, that s easier said than done, but there are some tools out there that can help your employees learn about what a typical phishing email looks like.",N/A,-1,-1
Ulevitch uses PhishMe for teaching his employees on what not to click; the service periodically sends out suspicious looking emails to employes in an effort to teach them what to look out for.,N/A,-1,-1
"Yes, the advent of the cloud has made it easier than ever to spin up servers and improve your efficiency.",N/A,-1,-1
"But you re putting yourself in harm s way if you haven t taken in account the simple things like making sure the system you are replicating to the cloud is properly patched and doesn t contain old software that hasn t been updated in over five years, explained Carson Sweet, CEO of CloudPassage.",Carson,50,50
"Sweet remembered a few years ago when an employee in a very large financial services organization once spawned thousands of Amazon images based on a  badly configured Amazon system,  thus exposing the firm to tons of vulnerabilities.",N/A,-1,-1
Sweet said he and his team referred to the original server as  Typhoid Mary.,N/A,-1,-1
"From the organizations Sweet has witnessed, he s seen roughly 50 percent of spun-up systems having vulnerabilities because services on the original server weren t properly patched.",N/A,-1,-1
"In these cases, it s probably best to have a systems administrator with knowledge on how to properly set up servers establish best practices for the company to follow.",N/A,-1,-1
"This is the kind of thing people don t think about,  said Sweet.",N/A,-1,-1
We are now taking systems and shoving them out of a firewall.,N/A,-1,-1
"Even though the advent of BYOD has made it increasingly difficult for companies to know who exactly is accessing their internal network from a given device or location, there s no excuse for being completely ignorant of your network s infrastructure.",N/A,-1,-1
"Hindawi said Tanium works with a large, global telco whose execs once thought they only had 22 egress points the parts of a network in which data can leave.",N/A,-1,-1
"After getting a security scan, the company learned that it actually had about 1,500 egress points.",N/A,-1,-1
"After investigating the issue, Tanium learned that the company was not aware of how often people were accessing the network from outside its firewalls.",N/A,-1,-1
"In some cases, executives were connecting to the corporate network from Starbucks and in one instance, a branch manager ordered his own Wi-Fi to access the company s system because the branch office s internet was too slow.",N/A,-1,-1
"This is just as bad as leaving doors unlocked,  Hindawi said.",N/A,-1,-1
"Although a company s network can be vast and it may not be easy to know everything that s connected to the network, you should at least know where your most important resources are stored and in this case you can use detection tools or analytic tools that can spot when things look problematic, said Jon Oltsik, an Enterprise Strategy Group senior principal analyst and founder of the firm s information security service.",Enterprise,61,61
"It s important to know the different threats aimed at different industries and to best arm yourself for the appropriate kinds of attacks depending on your area of business, said Oltsik.",N/A,-1,-1
"For example, the Target hacking debacle involved a memory scraping attack that s common in the retail industry but doesn t occur very often in the banking or health care industry, Oltsik said.",N/A,-1,-1
"As security reporter Brian Krebs explained during the Target breach, the malware used in these types of attacks affects a retailer s point-of-sales (POS) systems and can log credit card information after a user swipes his or her card.",N/A,-1,-1
"If you are in retail, you have to say  we have a risk of this attack, maybe we should lock down our POS system so they won t execute software,   said Oltsik.",N/A,-1,-1
"In this case, Oltsik highly recommended nailing down all of your network connections in order to block them from accessing suspicious web servers from places like the Ukraine so that malware won t have the chance to infect the system.",N/A,-1,-1
"While this relates back to properly configuring your servers to be deployed to the cloud, the idea of patching should pretty much extend to everything involving your company s technology.",N/A,-1,-1
"It should be obvious that by not patching your software, you re leaving yourself vulnerable to malware.",N/A,-1,-1
"This is not an advanced threat problem, this is a doing-your-job problem,  said Hindawi when asked about companies not patching or keeping their operating systems up-to-date.",N/A,-1,-1
We have literally billions of records in these companies that put ourselves at risk.,N/A,-1,-1
"Ulevitch acknowledged that even though patching is important, it can be difficult for some companies to keep track of everything that needs updating.",N/A,-1,-1
"However, companies can setup vulnerability scanners and configure them so they do a system check every couple of days; doing so will let organizations be aware when servers or software needs to be patched.",N/A,-1,-1

"Although it first caught on among web developers, the Docker system for deploying Linux containers could also be a boon for big data applications.",N/A,-1,-1
"Members of Altiscale, the Hadoop-as-a-service startup founded by former Yahoo CTO Raymie Stata, are working closely with the Docker community to integrate the technology with YARN, the resource management framework for Hadoop.",N/A,-1,-1
"Stata said the work is important for his company, as well as for anybody else dealing with a multi-tenant Hadoop environment.",N/A,-1,-1
"Not only does Docker provide a fast, standard way for deploying those applications onto YARN, but it also provides isolation between them.",N/A,-1,-1
Isolation is important in terms of security (a user might have permissions within a container that don t extend to the host cluster) and also in terms of performance.,N/A,-1,-1
"The relationship between Docker and Linux containers is one of fantastical simplification,  Stata said.",N/A,-1,-1
"For a company like Cloudera, he explained, Docker integration might be a  nice to have  because so many of its users are running on-premise, single-user Hadoop clusters.",N/A,-1,-1
"However, as more customers start wanting to run multiple types of jobs   maybe Spark here, or Matlab there   on top of YARN, or if Cloudera starts hosting more user jobs itself, being able to launch and manage isolated environments would become a bigger deal.",N/A,-1,-1
"It s not an accident that Altiscale has picked up the engineering here, because we are a service,  he said.",N/A,-1,-1
"He added,  We re driving it because it s a must-have for us   but they re all rooting us on.",N/A,-1,-1
"Although, Stata noted, Hortonworks is also committing a lot of resources to the Docker integration.",N/A,-1,-1
"However, there is one big improvement that has to happen before Docker becomes ready for most enterprise users to deploy it on YARN, explained Dinesh Subhraveti, an Altiscale engineer who has been working in the broader realm of Linux containers for years.",N/A,-1,-1
"That s the support of user ID namespaces within Docker, which will ensure that an application with root-level permissions can t compromise the host and therefore make it unsafe or hamstring performance for others containers.",N/A,-1,-1
Once that s done   probably near the end of this year   Hadoop users should be able to start launching Docker containers on YARN and be fairly confident there won t be any inherent security risks hanging around.,N/A,-1,-1
"Whether or not Hadoop users will flock to Docker remains to be seen, but Stata seems to think the desire to maximize the utility of YARN will drive some in that direction.",N/A,-1,-1
"[Docker] won t replace anything, it will sit side-by-side with the old way of doing things,  he said.",N/A,-1,-1
"However, he added, as people start trying distribute non-Java software (Hadoop and all its ecosystem are built on Java) as part of YARN applications, they might be begging for a standard approach to doing it.",N/A,-1,-1

"As Christin puts it:

What Darnton describes is an almost completely one-way approach to media   in the old days, news stories and other content were produced because an editor or editors decided they should be, either because they were trying to appeal to certain readers, or because they believed an issue was important and their audience should know about it, or some combination of those two factors.",N/A,-1,-1

"I ve talked to a number of current and former webOS team members as well as people with knowledge about the decision making process within LG over the last couple of weeks, and the picture emerging from those interviews is an ugly one, full of fights and corporate politics.",N/A,-1,-1

"Instead of busy home screens full of app shortcuts, LG s TV featured a simple tab-based launcher at the bottom of the screen that was somewhat reminiscent of the original webOS, while adapting its design philosophy to the TV environment.",N/A,-1,-1
"LG s webOS TVs didn t have separate menus for TV inputs, apps and web content, but instead treated everything like tabs on a horizontal launch bar.",N/A,-1,-1
"The launcher incorporated a kind of history, surfacing apps that users most recently launched and hiding rarely-used services, while still offering users a way to personalize their own experience.",N/A,-1,-1
"This was very different from LG s previous smart TV system, which was a convoluted mess of competing menus, shortcuts and app stores, and its clear vision also set itself apart from much of the competition.",N/A,-1,-1
"Critics seemed to like this approach, calling it  very, very well executed,   more intuitive than most other smart TVs  and even  the best smart TV UI we ve ever used.",N/A,-1,-1
"To the webOS team, these accolades were doubly rewarding.",N/A,-1,-1
"That s because the team had been in a several-month-long battle over the interface with LG managers in Korea, who preferred a vision that s been described to me as a mixture of the traditional LG smart TV platform and the user interface Samsung first introduced at CES 2013.",N/A,-1,-1
"If Korea had had its way, webOS TVs would have had an additional menu gallery of vertically-scrolling cards, including one for personal media sharing, one for browser bookmarks and one for all installed apps.",N/A,-1,-1
"Altogether, the UI was to consist of close to a dozen such cards that consumers would have had to rotate through to find the apps or content they wanted.",N/A,-1,-1
"The Silicon Valley team fought this interface tooth and nail, but LG moved forward with it   only to realize eventually that it had become too resource-intensive to run smoothly on its TV hardware.",Valley,2,2
"CES was approaching quickly, and LG s engineers ran out of time trying to make their complicated interface work, so the decision was made to go with the webOS launcher instead in order to have anything up and running at all.",N/A,-1,-1
"We got lucky,  said one member of the original webOS team, who like others in this story declined to be identified by name.",N/A,-1,-1
"I ve been told that this anecdote was symptomatic of many of the struggles the webOS team was facing across all parts of its operation, including engineering.",N/A,-1,-1
"Despite repeated requests, LG never hired more engineers for the Silicon Valley group.",Valley,12,12
"Instead, it put them at the mercy of engineers in Korea who were beholden to their local management, and frequently built features that the webOS team didn t ask for, or worse, had long fought against.",N/A,-1,-1
"On the engineering side, the webOS team also struggled with a culture clash of sorts that pitted company politics against its attempt to simplify the company s smart TV platform.",N/A,-1,-1
Sources told me that LG had a policy in place to reward managers with bonuses or even promotions if their features were part of the final product.,N/A,-1,-1
"The result was a constant feature bloat, as everyone tried to add on one more thing.",N/A,-1,-1
"The result of that policy can still be seen on LG s previous-generation smart TVs, which long featured not one but two app stores, forcing consumers to decide whether the app they were looking for was a  premium app  or a  smart world app.",N/A,-1,-1
"To consumers, those TVs were simply confusing.",N/A,-1,-1
"Insiders on the other hand recognized a representation of LG s internal power struggles, with each team getting their own, dedicated section in the UI, whether it made sense or not.",N/A,-1,-1

"GRAM was supposed to operate in stealth mode and incubate a whole range of new products and services for HP, but none of it actually ever launched.",N/A,-1,-1
"When LG eventually acquired the unit, spirits were high, because it seemed like an actual product launch was finally a real possibility   and because LG representatives told the team that it would was one of the most valuable assets within LG, with a clear mission of innovation.",N/A,-1,-1
"Here s how LG CTO Scott Ahn put it at the time of the acqusition:

Internally, the team was told that it shouldn t get bogged down by bureaucracy, and promised to operate largely independently.",Scott,5,5

"It has a stainless steel frame, works with any 22 millimeter watch band and connects to an Android phone over Bluetooth.",N/A,-1,-1
Inside the new model is an ever-so-slightly higher capacity battery: 410 mAh as opposed to the 400 mAh battery in LG s first edition.,N/A,-1,-1
"That s not likely to affect the run-time; instead, the more efficient OLED display, which should use less power than an LCD screen, could help.",N/A,-1,-1

"As the report puts it:

In other cases, a real need for a new tool might exist, but the barriers to its adoption might simply outweigh that need  ScraperWiki, for example, a 2011 News Challenge winner, received funding to adapt its tool to help journalists collect, store and publish data from across the Internet.",Challenge,39,39

Months before Google announced its Android Wear software for smartwatches I had said that the first company to put Google Now on my wrist would get my money.,N/A,-1,-1
There are multiple choices for me to put my money where my mouth is but I ve reneged on that commitment.,N/A,-1,-1
"Why is that 

I ve been thinking about that very question lately because next week I expect we ll see three more Android Wear watches to choose from.",N/A,-1,-1
"Asus has teased its first watch, the ZenWatch, for September 3, the Moto 360 is likely to appear at a press event the next day and LG has teased a round-faced watch to join the square one it already sells.",N/A,-1,-1
I ve already tested the Samsung Gear Live but didn t find it to offer a compelling experience.,N/A,-1,-1
"It s not the hardware that has my wallet shut tighter than a dog s mouth on a bone, although the first few designs were a little uninspired.",N/A,-1,-1
"If that were the issue, I d simply have my credit card ready for next week because the Moto 360 I saw in person two months ago was very impressive.",N/A,-1,-1
"There s definitely a fashion or style aspect involved here but I could probably overlook it: Heck, I ve bought some ugly phones in the past.",N/A,-1,-1
No: the issue is about software and purpose.,N/A,-1,-1
"Android Wear is fairly good about what it does, which mainly is to provide Google Now contextual notifications.",N/A,-1,-1
That s the very essence of the product.,N/A,-1,-1
"(Yes, there are also Android Wear apps; I ll get into that aspect a little later.",N/A,-1,-1
")

But is Google Now enough  The service is absolutely helpful; far more than Siri, for example.",N/A,-1,-1
"At various points during my day, Google Now notifies me that package has shipped or that traffic to my next scheduled destination is heavier than normal.",N/A,-1,-1
"In the latter case, it actually tells me to when to leave in advance so that I ll still make my appointment on time.",N/A,-1,-1
It knows these things by peeking at my mail and calendar.,N/A,-1,-1
These are ideal tidbits for a smartwatch because they re useful at a particular time and because they re easily digestible.,N/A,-1,-1
"That means with a quick glance, I can get extremely meaningful information.",N/A,-1,-1
"Yes, I can get this on my phone or computer as well.",N/A,-1,-1
"I m simply pointing out that these types of notifications fit in the context of a watch, but I don t get enough of these to justify spending $200 or more for them on my wrist.",N/A,-1,-1
"That brings Android Wear apps into the conversation because these too add value, right 

So far, I m not so sure; at least in the traditional definition of mobile apps.",N/A,-1,-1
Why  There s a key difference between apps for a watch and apps for a phone.,N/A,-1,-1
"On the phone, an app is meant to be engaging for some length of time.",N/A,-1,-1
"Sure, there are plenty of exceptions, such as a Google search, which is something else you can do on an Android Wear watch.",N/A,-1,-1
"But consider the apps that people use most, which are games, social networks, news, etc .",N/A,-1,-1
these all capture your attention for more than a split second.,N/A,-1,-1
Communication apps are also heavily used.,N/A,-1,-1
"Think Gmail and text messages, for example.",N/A,-1,-1
These too are supported with Android Wear but it s a clunky experience for a few reasons.,N/A,-1,-1
"For starters, do you really want every single email to buzz your wrist  I don t and I doubt most others do either.",N/A,-1,-1
You can configure Gmail to cut down on the notifications by setting up notifications solely for email that Gmail thinks are important.,N/A,-1,-1
"The setup process isn t intuitive though and for a watch, it really needs to be.",N/A,-1,-1
Note: JR Raphael shared setup procedures to help manage Gmail on Android Wear here.,N/A,-1,-1
"As a result, there s an unresolved dichotomy between mobile apps for a smartphone and for an Android Wear watch.",N/A,-1,-1
And it s going to take time for developers to think how they can effectively bring parts of their existing mobile app to the wrist in a way that will compel people to buy a smartwatch.,N/A,-1,-1
"I m not suggesting that every Android Wear app is useless or poorly designed; instead, I m pointing out a high level question that hasn t yet been answered.",N/A,-1,-1
"And since no Android Watch is a standalone device yet, both apps and notifications are readily available on the phone you have to have with you for these watches.",N/A,-1,-1
"So regardless of what hardware arrives next week or how good it looks, I think I m still in a holding pattern on an Android Wear purchase.",N/A,-1,-1
Google Now alone isn t worth it yet.,N/A,-1,-1
"And until we have enough  must have  apps that are better suited for at-a-glance use instead of watered down mobile apps built with a history of engagement, I suspect many others will hold off too.",N/A,-1,-1
"Yesterday Mathew Prince, the CEO of Cloudflare posted some awesome data on his company s blog showing that the U.S. has a higher cost for bandwidth than Europe.",N/A,-1,-1
"He s not the only one with such data, but he s one of the first to discuss it so openly and to dive into how the costs of peering versus buying transit affects those costs.",N/A,-1,-1
"First off, transit is where a company buys wholesale bandwidth on a per gigabyte basis from providers that can range from Level 3 and Tata to companies like Comcast or AT&T.",N/A,-1,-1
"Peering on the other hand, is a direct link to another providers  network that can be paid or set up as a free exchange of traffic.",N/A,-1,-1

"As Prince (pictured above) explains in his post, these cross-connects are a part of the overall cost associated with setting up direct peering agreements.",N/A,-1,-1
"From his post:

Because of the high rate of peering and the low transit costs, Europe is the least expensive region in the world for bandwidth.<br /> The higher rate of peering is due in part to the organization of the region s  peering exchanges .",N/A,-1,-1
"A peering exchange is a service where networks can pay a fee to join, and then easily exchange traffic between each other without having to run individual cables between each others  routers.",N/A,-1,-1
"Networks connect to a peering exchange, run a single cable, and then can connect to many other networks.",N/A,-1,-1
"Since using a port on a router has a cost (routers cost money, have a finite number of ports, and a port used for one network cannot be used for another), and since data centers typically charge a monthly fee for running a cable between two different customers (known as a  cross connect ), connecting to one service, using one port and one cable, and then being able to connect to many networks can be very cost effective.<br />

So in places where cross-connect costs are high, it can make less sense to peer until you re a much bigger player because instead of paying fees associated with direct peering, buying transit on a per gigabit basis can be more economical.",N/A,-1,-1
Transit prices continue to drop!,N/A,-1,-1
"And in the U.S. cross-connect pricing is high, as this chart from TeleGeography shows.",N/A,-1,-1
"Jon Hjembo, a TeleGeography analyst, explains the differences in U.S. versus European cost-connect pricing as a matter of business models between exchanges (Prince does too).",N/A,-1,-1
"Hjembo notes that in Europe, third-party internet exchanges are much more common where different providers and exchanges all co-locate in data centers.",N/A,-1,-1
These hubs make it easy for many providers to directly connect their networks at a low cost.,N/A,-1,-1
"Due to the established market dynamic there, connectivity would never be a money-maker for European colo [co-location] providers even if they wanted it to be,  Hjembo said via email.",N/A,-1,-1
"In the U.S., there s a history of prominent colo providers offering their own IXs [internet exchanges]in-house.",N/A,-1,-1
Operators can charge premiums for access to more network-dense ecosystems.,N/A,-1,-1
So business models like data center provider Equinix s mean that connectivity costs more because as a single provider of a neutral meeting point for carriers those connectivity costs are where it makes some of its revenue.,N/A,-1,-1
"However, that model may be shifting as companies like Netflix and Digital Realty push to bring the European model to this country.",N/A,-1,-1
"Hjembo also noted that in the data above he couldn t get information from every single market player, but if it were universal he s  certain the disparity would be even higher.",N/A,-1,-1
"So we have higher interconnection costs for smaller providers in the U.S. that can lead to higher set up-costs for peering, which in turn raises U.S. bandwidth prices.",N/A,-1,-1
We also have a regulatory vacuum and an uncompetitive last-mile broadband market that s further distorting the market for bandwidth costs.,N/A,-1,-1
"Together these two things could drive up prices, and even if the cross-connect pricing drops, the last-mile monopoly might end up pushing prices up faster than they might be lowered at the data center.",N/A,-1,-1
"As Prince notes in his piece, peering in the U.S. is becoming a hot topic thanks to Netflix fighting with the major U.S. ISPs for the ability to deliver its content to subscribers at the top four ISPs without having to pay for direct interconnection.",N/A,-1,-1
There are two types of peering  the type where two networks interconnect because it s beneficial to them and which is how 99 percent of the peering agreements happen or paying the provider a fee to peer with them based on how much traffic is sent over the link.,N/A,-1,-1
"Netflix now pays to send traffic to AT&T, Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Verizon.",Warner,14,14
"Netflix now pays to send traffic to AT&T, Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Verizon.",Cable,15,15
"We ve covered why this is a problem, as does Prince, but Dave Burstein, a respected writer covering telecommunications also does a good job pointing out that while the current prices ISPs are charging Netflix for interconnection rates are low, they represent a shift in the network neutrality fight.",N/A,-1,-1
The issue with network neutrality is that we need it because the last-mile broadband market is not competitive.,N/A,-1,-1
"If a consumer s ISPs starts blocking content or charging content companies more to deliver their bits, the consumer can t vote with their feet.",N/A,-1,-1
The FCC has decided that network neutrality only affects the last mile connection between the consumer and the ISP s network.,N/A,-1,-1
"Meanwhile, peering fees are charged where a content provider wants to get onto the ISP s network, putting it outside the net neutrality fight.",N/A,-1,-1
"But the lack of competition is still a problem, and regulators need to be aware that ISPs are seeking to exploit that vacuum for their own gain, as Burstein reports.",N/A,-1,-1
He starts by saying he has a  very senior person  at one of the largest U.S. ISPs confirming that his company intends to collect on these peering fees.,N/A,-1,-1
It s a concept called sender pays and people in the telcos have been arguing for that for decades as a way to keep their revenues in line with their 20th century infrastructure and business models.,N/A,-1,-1

The disappearing documents episode is par for the course for a public records system that gobbles money but remains buggy and out of date.,N/A,-1,-1
"Most frustrating of all is that, as the late internet activist Aaron Swartz showed everyone, the documents could be made easily available at little cost.",N/A,-1,-1
The PACER problem is not hard to solve.,N/A,-1,-1
But it will require the right people to acknowledge that the obstacles are political and financial rather than technological.,N/A,-1,-1
"The legal community reacted angrily this week when they discovered the disappearance of the documents, which span years of online filings from venues like the patent appeals court, the 2nd Circuit and the bankruptcy court for Los Angeles.",Los Angeles,38,39
"The frustration stems from a new and arbitrary impediment to public information, and from the manner of PACER s explanation, which came as a one paragraph notice:

When contacted by phone, a PACER supervisor explained that the five courts in question were using a legacy platform for older court records, and that these records could not be migrated to an impending update to PACER.",N/A,-1,-1
"The supervisor, who did not want to be named, also explained that the purpose of the upgrade was to let users employ the same login credentials for both PACER (which lets users view and download documents) and a related system called CM/ECF, which lawyers use to file court documents online.",N/A,-1,-1
"While the single sign-on feature is an improvement, it s still unclear why the upgrade process couldn t also have included the legacy system used by the five courts, or why the courts didn t simply migrate the legacy system documents onto PACER.",N/A,-1,-1
"The supervisor also offered only an opaque explanation as to why the country s various federal courts   which include district, appeals and bankruptcy courts  use different IT systems in the first place.",N/A,-1,-1
Each court controls their own case information.,N/A,-1,-1
"Within each court, you re going to have different individuals who are more innovative or pro-active,  he said.",N/A,-1,-1
"Later on Tuesday, a spokesperson for the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, which overseas PACER, provided a statement to reporters about the disappearing documents   but one that simply repeated the original website notice.",N/A,-1,-1
Problems with PACER are nothing new but what is so vexing to the legal community is that no amount of money seems to solve them.,N/A,-1,-1
"In 2009, for instance, the judiciary had a reported surplus of $150 million in its Information Technology Fund while, in 2013, PACER prices jumped from 8 cents to 10 cents a page.",N/A,-1,-1

"Or David Zvenyach, a lawyer who this year created a script that monitors and displays unannounced changes to every Supreme Court decision.",N/A,-1,-1
"Why then, hasn t someone come forward to offer a better public version of PACER  The answer is that they ve tried, but the effort was short-lived.",N/A,-1,-1

"Swartz was not charged (in this case at least) but the FBI investigation ended the project, and now the FAQ section on PACER s homepage warns that unauthorized attempts to collect its data (which is in the public domain) may result in  criminal prosecution :

"The Office has little to say about IT upgrades but, on the  Publications and Reports  section of its website, visitors can view a  Courtroom Technology Manual  from 1999 that covers subjects like  A/V racks  and  paging systems.",N/A,-1,-1
PACER is not inherently a bad system; it s simply a dated one.,N/A,-1,-1
"Indeed, as the federal courts  own 25-year retrospective article explains, PACER was a very disruptive piece of technology that changed courthouse culture by, among other things, eliminating a stream of couriers and court runners.",N/A,-1,-1
"And compared to some state courts, which have yet to offer digital records in the first place, PACER was ahead of its time.",N/A,-1,-1
"So what happened  Why has the federal courts  IT system stagnated despite more money  The answer, unsurprisingly, is that the money has gone elsewhere.",N/A,-1,-1
"In 2010, researcher Steve Schultze revealed that most of the money collected from PACER is being used for a host of other court-related expenses, such as flat screen monitors and notification systems for bankruptcy creditors.",N/A,-1,-1
"In short, the Administrative Office of the Courts has taken a liberal interpretation of a fee-collection provision of the 2002 E-Government Act, and treated it as a general revenue source   while also failing to improve PACER.",N/A,-1,-1
"While this apparent misallocation came under repeated scrutiny by former Senator Joe Lieberman and by journalists like Tim Lee, it has continued all the same.",Lee,18,18
"More recently, activist Aaron Greenspan has filed a lawsuit over the PACER fees.",N/A,-1,-1
"Meanwhile, some suggest that PACER s policies are driven in part by a desire to collect bulk download fees from private companies like WestLaw and Bloomberg, which in turn charge their subscribers high fees to search and curate the same court records found on PACER itself.",N/A,-1,-1
Easier access to the court records could compromise revenue streams for both the court system and the companies.,N/A,-1,-1

But there s still the question of who should pay.,N/A,-1,-1
"While there is nothing wrong with court fees themselves, which have existed since the 13th century, PACER s present practice of charging 10 cents for court records appears doubly misguided.",N/A,-1,-1
"The PACER charges not only bear no relation to the actual charge of supplying the records, but they also pose an access-to-justice obstacle for citizens, scholars and everyone else who uses the legal system (while PACER waives the fee for accounts that accrue under $15 a quarter, this policy is typically unhelpful since many filings cost $3 to view and a single case may contain hundreds of filings).",N/A,-1,-1
"But since Congress is unlikely to replace any revenue lost from the PACER fees, the judiciary s best option is to seek those fees elsewhere, including from the litigants who file the case in the first place.",Congress,2,2
"To create pressure for such a move is hardly easy, however, since responsibility for such decisions lies with the Judicial Conference of the United States, a group that is (rightly) immune to most forms of political persuasion.",N/A,-1,-1

"And close to 80 percent of those surveyed said that if a site forced them to login with their offline identity, they would choose not to comment at all.",N/A,-1,-1
"What that means in practice is that if a site like The Huffington Post or ESPN requires their users to login with Facebook or provide a  real  identity in some other way, they are likely shutting out as many as 80 percent of their readers.",Post,13,13
"While at least some of these may be trolls or bad actors of some kind, it s reasonable to assume that a significant number are loyal members of that site s community, who may have something important or worthwhile to contribute.",N/A,-1,-1
"As David Williams, community manager for CNN Digital, said in an interview with Managing Communities:

The Livefyre survey is a relatively small sampling of readers, and some of the conclusions   the fact that only 5 percent of readers login anonymously so they can bully others, for example   may be suspect, simply because few people are going to admit that they login specifically to torment other people.",Williams,2,2
"That said, however, the survey results jibe with my experience managing comments and community for a large metropolitan newspaper in a previous life.",N/A,-1,-1
"When I asked our readers about whether they would comment if the paper implemented a registration system that required a verifiable identity, a large number said they never would   and they said that their desire for anonymity was a result of wanting to take part in discussions about contentious issues like religious freedom, sexual identity and the Middle East: In other words, important topics where their views might impact their jobs or their personal life in some way.",N/A,-1,-1
"As Livefyre points out, there are a number of ways that sites can cut down on bad behavior, including pre-moderation.",N/A,-1,-1

"If nothing is done, according to a Delforge blog post:  data center electricity consumption is projected to increase to roughly 140 billion kilowatt-hours annually by 2020, requiring the equivalent annual output of 17 new power plants, costing American businesses $13 billion annually in electricity bills and emitting nearly 150 million metric tons of carbon pollution annually.",N/A,-1,-1
The NRDC has a couple of recommendations that it says will help cut energy use.,N/A,-1,-1
"For context, many data centers use Power Usage Effectiveness, or PUE scores, to show the overall energy efficiency of their facilities.",N/A,-1,-1
"That is fine and dandy, but not enough, according to the NRDC.",N/A,-1,-1
"PUE rates the efficiency of the facility, not of the IT within it,  Delforge said via email.",N/A,-1,-1
"There are many very efficient data centers which only have say 10 percent overhead for cooling and power distribution, but have their servers running idle or grossly underutilized.",N/A,-1,-1
It s like an airline flying a highly efficient plane empty or with less than 10 percent of seats filled: the carbon footprint per passenger would be very high.,N/A,-1,-1
What NRDC wants is a simple metric to measure how efficiently the IT gear in the data center is operated.,N/A,-1,-1
This is complementary to PUE.,N/A,-1,-1
"And to run an efficient data center, both metrics are important,  he added.",N/A,-1,-1
"Gigaom Research analyst Dave Ohara said the report brings up valid points, but more factors need to be considered.",N/A,-1,-1
"CPU utilization is just one metric, Ohara said via email.",N/A,-1,-1
"RAM and hard-disks also use up energy   and can be just as underutilized    The problem is that IT asset management is mostly done as a bookkeeping exercise, not as part of a technical IT operations team who purchases, owns and operates the servers.",N/A,-1,-1
"Still, a single, uniform way to measure server CPU usage is a good first step down the road to better energy efficiency and transparency around that efficiency.",N/A,-1,-1
"Working with connected thermostats in 22,000 homes in Nevada, startup EcoFactor was able to reduce those homes  air conditioning usage by 11 percent   one of the highest rates among its competitors   and also saved those customers about $100 per year last year.",Nevada,8,8
"That means the energy reduction per home, and the energy savings from air conditioning, in its program were more than Nest achieved in comparable projects and produced far more savings than Opower s behavioral techniques, EcoFactor said.",N/A,-1,-1
"That data is coming from the utilities commission and filed by utility NV Energy, and EcoFactor released on Tuesday.",Energy,13,13
"NV Energy uses EcoFactor s software for its  mPowered  program, which seeks to lower the energy consumption of its customers during hot summer months in a cost effective way and with minimal impact on the customer.",Energy,1,1
EcoFactor was founded in 2006 and launched in late 2009.,N/A,-1,-1
"It uses software to pull in data about things like weather, demographics, and home owner behavior.",N/A,-1,-1
"EcoFactor uses all this data to tweak a home s connected thermostat settings ever so slightly to shave energy consumption, but also to maintain a comfortable temperature in the home.",N/A,-1,-1
The thermostats can also be used for lowering energy consumption when utilities expect a spike in AC or heating usage during a specific time of day.,N/A,-1,-1
"EcoFactor s software is like Nest s learning thermostat, but without the hardware.",N/A,-1,-1
EcoFactor can work with any connected thermostat and it runs in the cloud.,N/A,-1,-1

"Many journalists seem to dismiss Reddit as an internet freak-show of sorts, the kind of place that hosts discussion forums about nerdy topics like League of Legends   and even when the site does something respectable like an  Ask Me Anything  crowdsourced Q&A with President Obama, people mostly just talk about how someone asked him the infamous duck-sized horse question that has become a fixture of such interviews.",Many,0,0
"In other words, not a place for serious journalism.",N/A,-1,-1
"Even after Reddit introduced its new  Reddit Live  reporting tool, which makes it easier for users in sub-Reddits like the excellent Syrian Civil War forum to post real-time updates about breaking news, there seemed to be little interest in acknowledging that the site could be useful for journalists, apart from a grudging admission that it can sometimes help drive pageviews.",N/A,-1,-1
"As Reddit general manager Erik Martin noted in a recent interview, one of the biggest benefits of Reddit s massive user-base and the levels of engagement there often goes unappreciated, and that is the ability for journalists to see what different groups or communities think about a particular issue.",Martin,5,5
"As he described it:

 If you cover healthcare in the United States, you can go on Reddit and see what new parents think about this, what people in Oklahoma think about this, what people with chronic pain or some sort of disability think about it, and so forth.",Oklahoma,31,31
"Reddit has all these different communities, you can observe conversations without interaction.",N/A,-1,-1
So I think for a journalist it is a fascinating and useful resource.,N/A,-1,-1
"So why don t more journalists see this as an opportunity to engage with different communities of interest around stories that they think are important  I think Martin puts his finger on the problem when he says that it s a cultural   and possibly even generational   thing, in the sense that some journalists simply aren t interested in what users on Reddit or anywhere else have to say about the topics they write about, because acknowledging or responding to reader feedback simply isn t a part of what they consider to be their job.",Martin,27,27
"For the most part, Martin says, many journalists don t even care about the reader comments on their own sites   because they believe them to be troll and flame-war filled sewers   so why would they care about a discussion happening on some internet community platform somewhere 

 I think it s just habits, and part of it is maybe generational.",Martin,5,5
"I mean it s unfortunate that when you talk to a lot of journalists and say  well you have comments on your site,  and they have a  don t care  attitude about it.",N/A,-1,-1

"It s not about the technology   it can help, but its more about how active you are, do you have/are you paying people to moderate it and get involved  

The point I ve tried to make in the past is that connecting with a community of passionate readers around a topic that is important to them, whatever that topic may be, is a crucial part in the age of digital journalism and short attention-span media   and journalists who fail to develop the skills necessary to engage with readers will face a difficult future.",N/A,-1,-1

BitTorrent s Dropbox competitor Sync received a major update Tuesday that makes it even easier to share files with friends and contacts: The P2P-based file synchronization tool can now be used to generate web links for shared files and folders.,N/A,-1,-1
"BitTorrent also announced Tuesday that Sync has already been installed 10 million times, and been used to transfer more than 80 petabytes of data.",N/A,-1,-1
"When BitTorrent first launched Sync with a closed pre-alpha in early 2013, the emphasis was on folder synchronization across desktop computers and network-attached storage drives.",N/A,-1,-1
"BitTorrent subsequently also released Sync versions for Android, iOS and Windows Phone, giving users an easy way to back up all the pictures off their phone, or synchronize desktop folders with their tablet.",N/A,-1,-1
"However, inviting others to access a shared folder had always been a bit complicated: File transfers were both encrypted and without any central server, so users had to exchange cryptographic keys in order to securely share data with each other.",N/A,-1,-1
"BitTorrent tried to make this easier by adding QR codes, but it was still a bit of a roadblock.",N/A,-1,-1
"That obstacle is now gone, thanks to Sync s new ability to generate web links for shared folders.",N/A,-1,-1
"These web links prompt invited users to install the latest version of Sync, and then automatically initiate a download, provided that the other user is online as well.",N/A,-1,-1
"Web links automatically expire after three days, but users can change this to make folders available permanently, or have them expire even sooner.",N/A,-1,-1
"Links can also be limited to a certain number of users to prevent accidental sharing, and users can choose to individually approve each user, either just by name, or by comparing cryptographic keys.",N/A,-1,-1
And users who don t wan to generate a web link can still share data the old-fashioned way by sharing cryptographic keys directly.,N/A,-1,-1
Sync can also be used to share folders of any size with a team of users.,N/A,-1,-1
"This could be great for small companies, or any other team that doesn t want to rely on cloud storage for one reason or another.",N/A,-1,-1
"And since it s P2P, access to that folder can be significantly faster than to a cloud service: A co-worker in the same office can access it over the local network, and even remote coworkers can get a boost when multiple members of the team are sharing the same files   Sync automatically downloads files from multiple locations.",N/A,-1,-1
That ability to share files within company teams is interesting for a number of reasons.,N/A,-1,-1
"Many traditional cloud storage and backup tools started out as consumer-focused tools, only to eventually focus on the enterprise.",Many,0,0

T-Mobile says this data will be on top of the 200 MB of free data it offers each month to all of its slate customers.,Mobile,1,1
"T-Mobile has been on a tear lately, bringing in the bulk of new smartphone connections in the last few quarters, but AT&T and Verizon certainly haven t stopped growing, and one of the big reasons why is the recent surge in new 4G tablet subscriptions.",Mobile,1,1
"T-Mobile clearly sees the writing on the wall: carriers are basically just luring the same smartphone customers away from one another, but tablets represent a relatively untapped market.",Mobile,1,1
"It remains to be seen whether T-Mobile s pricing moves will put a dent in AT&T and Verizon s tablet success, which is largely driven by shared data policies that make it easy to tack a slate onto to your existing data plan.",Mobile,7,7
T-Mobile s new tablet plans don t create shared data buckets   you get a separate smartphone bucket and separate tablet bucket of equal size   so they re not quite as flexible as AT&T and Verizon s shared plans.,Mobile,1,1

But I m not sold on the idea that Windows RT is dead quite yet or that this is the beginnings of a fire sale.,N/A,-1,-1
Bear in mind that the Surface Pro 3 tablet was updated quickly compared to the Surface Pro 2.,Bear,0,0
"Microsoft needed to tweak the device to better compete against other ultrabooks, including Apple s MacBook Air.",N/A,-1,-1
"By comparison, the Surface 2 looks to be on a more traditional upgrade cycle and likely has less profit margin built in.",N/A,-1,-1
"If Microsoft was going to invest in an early device refresh, it made more sense to do so on the Pro line of hardware.",N/A,-1,-1
"In terms of software, you can t overlook one of the main themes of Microsoft s Build developer event this past April: Universal apps will let developers create software that can run on any Microsoft device, be it a phone, tablet or PC.",N/A,-1,-1
This approach can help overcome one of the bigger issues with Windows RT   the lack of certain applications.,N/A,-1,-1
"Granted, this will take time but it s a thought that can help keep RT alive a bit longer.",N/A,-1,-1
I m also not sure Microsoft wants to be beholden to Intel forever.,N/A,-1,-1
"Yes, the WinTel alliance has helped Windows become the most used operating system on traditional computers.",N/A,-1,-1
But it s done little if anything for Microsoft on more mobile devices.,N/A,-1,-1
Microsoft s Windows RT effort was a chance to break out from the influence that Intel wields by using alternative processor technology based on IP from ARM Holdings and its partners.,N/A,-1,-1
"That s why I think Intel quickly brought Intel Atom into tablets and hybrids, even if it has to spend millions to subsidize the chips.",N/A,-1,-1

"While the California measure is popular at a time when mobile phone theft has become a serious crime problem in many cities, it will not make a major difference to most consumers and phone makers.",California,2,2

The latest leak coming from NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden s trove involves a  Google-like  search engine for communications metadata called ICREACH.,N/A,-1,-1
The program was described in a Monday article in The Intercept.,N/A,-1,-1
"ICREACH appears to be one of the main tools that the NSA uses to share metadata with 23 other U.S. government agencies, including the FBI, CIA and DEA, as well as with corresponding signals intelligence agencies in the other four members of the Anglophone  Five Eyes  club: Canada, the U.K., New Zealand and Australia.",Canada,51,51
Metadata is data that describes data.,N/A,-1,-1
"In this case, the communications metadata shared through ICREACH reportedly covers  emails, phone calls, faxes, internet chats, and text messages, as well as location information collected from cellphones.",N/A,-1,-1
"According to memos leaked by Snowden, the ICREACH program went live in 2007 under  mastermind  Keith Alexander, the former NSA director, as a way of helping analysts sift through a multitude of databases.",Alexander,17,17
It was apparently the successor to earlier systems called CRISSCROSS and PROTON.,N/A,-1,-1
"The Office of the Director of National Intelligence told The Intercept that the relevant metadata is collected under Executive Order 12333, which allows the collection of data outside the U.S. with little oversight.",N/A,-1,-1

"Facebook seems to be trying to get more transparent about how the algorithms behind the social-networking site function, with a statement on Monday about how it is cracking down on  clickbait.",N/A,-1,-1
"And just like the last time Facebook tweaked its algorithm (and the time before that), everyone is trying to figure out whether it will help or hurt sites like Upworthy or BuzzFeed   or their own site.",N/A,-1,-1
"But despite the attempts at openness, the bottom line remains the same: Facebook is a black box.",N/A,-1,-1
No one really has any clue why the site chooses to show or hide certain content.,N/A,-1,-1
"A lot of the attention around this latest change, like the one before it, has been focused on trying to decipher what Facebook means by the term  clickbait.",N/A,-1,-1
"But as John Hermann points out at The Awl   and as I tried to argue the last time the site started fiddling with the algorithm   clickbait is one of those things that everyone thinks they know when it appears, but no one can really define.",Hermann,3,3
"The bottom line is that whether it s a slideshow or a listicle with GIFs, one person s clickbait is another person s fascinating and shareable content.",N/A,-1,-1
"Even Facebook can t seem to define exactly what it is trying to stamp out:

From that description, what the site seems to be targeting isn t so much clickbait-style stories or posts, but clickbait headlines   mostly the so-called  curiosity gap  style headlines that promise some earth-shattering revelation and then don t follow through on it (Techmeme often rewrites headlines for the same reason).",N/A,-1,-1
"In other words, some of the same posts that seem to bother people so much will likely continue to exist and be ranked highly, provided the people posting them describe them accurately in the headline.",N/A,-1,-1
Even the example that Facebook used for its post could continue to be shared and highly ranked.,N/A,-1,-1
A related question is whether Facebook itself is partly   or even largely   responsible for the state of affairs it is now trying to correct by tweaking the algorithm.,N/A,-1,-1
"When product manager Mike Hudack complained earlier this year about the decline of online media into an orgy of shameless clickbait, he was hit by a barrage of criticism about Facebook s role in promoting that kind of content, since media outlets see the social network as the holy grail of site traffic, which is their bread and butter (for his part, Hudack said the network was trying to help in that regard   efforts that may have resulted in the latest algorithm change).",N/A,-1,-1
"In any case, the bottom line for both media sites and users alike is that Facebook s algorithm is very similar to Google s algorithm, in the sense that it s a black box, one whose inner workings are almost totally inscrutable.",N/A,-1,-1
"Just as sites like Metafilter occasionally find that their traffic has fallen off a cliff due to some mysterious change in Google s ranking methods, so Facebook routinely elevates or smothers certain types of content   a good example being the  social readers  that many media outlets such as The Guardian came out with in 2012, only to see their usefulness evaporate overnight after Facebook tweaked its algorithm.",N/A,-1,-1
"But the reasons why Facebook chooses to highlight specific types of content and hide others remain completely hidden from users and publishers   and explanations like the one it gave for the latest change don t really help that much, in part because they raise almost as many questions as they answer.",N/A,-1,-1
"The practical impact of this algorithm-driven becomes obvious during an event like the demonstrations in Ferguson, Mo.",Ferguson,15,15
"While Twitter was filled with live reporting about the incident and its aftermath, many users complained that Facebook was almost silent on the news.",N/A,-1,-1
Was that because of the way certain stories were shared  Was it because people didn t click on Ferguson headlines  Or was it because Facebook chose to highlight uplifting personal stories instead of depressing and violent news events  No one knows.,Ferguson,18,18
"Like a newspaper publisher with editors who choose which stories are important and which aren t, Facebook decides what to show based on its own criteria   criteria that are largely unshared with the outside world, and therefore can only be inferred based on external signals.",N/A,-1,-1
"Is that a good thing or a bad thing  Ultimately, that s for each user to determine for themselves.",N/A,-1,-1
But the fact remains that what comes through Facebook is the site s version of what you should be reading   and what you need to know about the world   not your version.,N/A,-1,-1

What these systems all have in common is their use of mobile carriers  networks to track your phone s movements or to sense its location in real time.,N/A,-1,-1
"By tapping into the carriers  signaling networks, governments and hackers alike can query the location of a particular phone at any time, even if it s outside the country, according to the Post s in-depth explanation.",Post,35,35

"Private companies  decision to sell such technology to the highest bidder is likely raising hackles among many of you, but you also might be wondering why our mobile carriers are tracking this kind of information in the first place, and why they appear to sharing it with any spook that asks for it.",N/A,-1,-1
The answer is a bit complicated.,N/A,-1,-1
Cellular is basically the ultimate location-based service.,N/A,-1,-1
"While you can opt in or out of location-sharing for any particular app, you can t turn off network tracking at the most fundamental level.",N/A,-1,-1
Otherwise your phone calls and data would never reach you.,N/A,-1,-1
"While a residential phone line always leads to one physical location, the  line  of a mobile phone is basically set up over radio waves every time you place or take a call or send or receive a packet of data.",N/A,-1,-1
"In order to ensure that line is always reachable, your phone is constantly screaming its location to the nearest cell tower.",N/A,-1,-1
That way YouTube knows exactly to which base station to send your video stream and Verizon knows which cell site to route your calls at any given moment.,N/A,-1,-1
"Not only do networks need to know your location, they need to share it because our phones don t operate on a single network.",N/A,-1,-1

"And as the Post points out those networks are notoriously insecure, allowing anyone with the the right know-how and right equipment to pluck your location within a few blocks radius out of the telecom ether.",Post,3,3

ShakeAlert detects earthquakes via around 300 sensors scattered across California.,California,9,9
They measure what are known as P-waves: non-destructive waves of energy that travel much faster than the S-waves earthquakes produce that cause shaking and damage.,N/A,-1,-1

It determines the origin and size of an earthquake based on the shape of the P-waves.,N/A,-1,-1

So why didn t every single resident in the Bay Area get that same warning as BART  The answer is funding.,Bay,9,9
It s been law since 2013 that California needs to establish a state-wide earthquake early warning system.,California,7,7
But the law states that funding won t come from California s general fund.,California,10,10
The damage from the Napa earthquake could exceed $1 billion.,Napa,4,4
"As many as 200 people were hospitalized with minor and serious injuries, according to the San Jose Mercury News.",San Jose,16,17
"Interest in earthquake protection is now high, and Allen said there are several potential ways to secure funding.",Allen,9,9
"ShakeAlert is close to receiving government money in Sacramento, and people in other parts of the state can contact their legislators to express their support.",Sacramento,8,8
The best bet is the $7.5 billion water bond that will be voted on in November; it contains funding for an earthquake warning system.,N/A,-1,-1
"If it does go into effect, a state-wide system could be integrated into more than just transit systems like BART.",N/A,-1,-1
A self-driving car could automatically stop before entering a tunnel and a factory could shutdown and protect any equipment that contains dangerous materials.,N/A,-1,-1
Many of the fires that started after the Napa quake were likely caused by broken natural gas lines that could have been shut off by a warning system.,Napa,8,8

The most interesting wearable technology on the court at this year s US Open won t be on the tennis players.,N/A,-1,-1
"While watching the US Open, keep an eye on the ball boys and girls   those young people chasing errant balls around the court   wearing skintight black Ralph Lauren shirts.",N/A,-1,-1
"Those shirts are wirelessly connected and they are packing some very cool wearable technology from OMsignal, which provides the capability to take readings of the various ball boys  heart rate, breathing levels, and movement.",N/A,-1,-1
"As can be expected from a preppy haberdasher like Ralph Lauren, the black form-fitting compression shirts do look good, especially on the male models and in-shape ball boys currently testing them out.",N/A,-1,-1
Below the big Polo logo lies the OMsignal technology: a band of specialized fabric around the wearer s midsection which has silver sensor threads woven through it and includes three ECG leads.,Polo,3,3
The band of sensors works in conjunction with a small device that clips to one side of the shirt that allows data to be recorded and synced through Bluetooth with a Ralph Lauren-branded app.,N/A,-1,-1
"The  black box  includes an accelerometer and gyroscope, as well as the Bluetooth hardware needed to sync with a mobile device.",N/A,-1,-1
"It s powered by a small watch battery   so although it won t need regular charging, it will eventually need a replacement battery.",N/A,-1,-1
"And in a nod to olfactory common sense, the black box can be detached and used with other compatible shirts, so you won t need to wear the same shirt every time you work out.",N/A,-1,-1
One of the advantages to the OMsignal approach to embedding sensors in a shirt is that it can measure breathing.,N/A,-1,-1
"While there are several wearable products that can measure heart rate, far fewer can measure the rate of breathing.",N/A,-1,-1
"Since breathing can be the key to estimating biometric stats like exertion and effort, as well as provide useful feedback on its own for athletes, that capability helped tip Ralph Lauren into pairing up with OMsignal.",N/A,-1,-1

"A lot of these [wearable] technology companies are small,  Ralph Lauren SVP David Lauren said.",N/A,-1,-1
We went with OMSignal because they had the longest list of capabilities.,N/A,-1,-1
"The shirts still need a few tweaks: During one demo, a model was doing pushups and the heart rate reading on the paired iPhone didn t immediately rise.",N/A,-1,-1
"It wasn t because he was in immaculate shape, but because of an error with the sensor.",N/A,-1,-1
A Ralph Lauren spokesperson explained that sometimes there needs to be a little bit of sweat in order to get an accurate reading.,N/A,-1,-1
"The shirts will make their match play debut in Flushing Meadows on Tuesday, although they ve already been deployed on ball boys during the qualifying rounds.",Flushing,9,9

"Like us, the creators of the project believe the future is in fiber and faster connections.",N/A,-1,-1
And while the report is very clear that many of these projects are still in the planning and press release stages (I call it gigawashing when I m feeling frustrated) it offers a nice rundown of all the projects currently happening.,N/A,-1,-1
"And reading the report, it s clear there are two things driving the expansion of gigabit services.",N/A,-1,-1
"The first is a willingness by municipalities to act as a partner, not an impediment, and work with providers to get fiber in the ground acting .",N/A,-1,-1
And the second is competition.,N/A,-1,-1
"As the chart above from the Gig.U report shows, there are few cities getting a gig from one provider.",N/A,-1,-1
"The report credits Google with promoting the idea of a gigabit service and getting communities and consumers excited, but it also has galvanized the incumbent cable and telco providers to upgrade their networks (or at least promise to upgrade their networks).",N/A,-1,-1

"VMware is working together with Docker, Google and Pivotal to make sure that container technology works well with its virtualization technology, it said Monday during VMworld 2014.",N/A,-1,-1
"This announcement is a bold move by VMware to push support for Docker containers, which some industry watchers have indicated could possibly pose a threat one day to VMware s dominance in IT operations.",N/A,-1,-1
"Through this collaboration, VMware will allow developers and operations staff to use the Docker Engine with the VMware vSphere hypervisor and the company s vCloud Air environment.",N/A,-1,-1
The company will also team up with Docker on several open source container projects on the Docker platform and it plans on making sure future Docker projects will integrate well with the rest of the VMware platform.,N/A,-1,-1
VMware is also partnering with Google to ensure its Kubernetes container management system can work well with VMware s software; the company has already been contributing code to that project as well.,N/A,-1,-1
"Regarding Pivotal, VMware said in an announcement that the platform-as-a-service (PaaS) company has already been using containers in conjunction with virtual machines as part of its application-development platform since 2011.",N/A,-1,-1
"During the keynote session at VMworld 2014, VMware s CEO Pat Gelsinger said that VMware s new container push is called Project Fargo and its purpose is to  enable containers on virtual machines  and will eventually show that running a container in conjunction with a VM will prove to be even more lightweight than running a container on a bare-metal machine.",Fargo,23,23
"We call this containers without compromise,  said Gelsinger.",N/A,-1,-1
The spate of container-related announcements highlights the importance VMware sees in containers and how they can affect the company s bottom line.,N/A,-1,-1
While containers are essentially lighter-weight versions of virtual machines   in that they don t require multiple operating systems to be spun out but instead share a host Linux-based OS   the technology is still in its nascent stage.,N/A,-1,-1
"While new tools are seemingly being developed on the Docker platform each week that aim to improve how containers are used in operations, the tools are not quite sophisticated as of yet to handle major workloads like Google or streamline the creation of complex applications that rely on relational or NoSQL databases.",N/A,-1,-1
VMware appears to want to show that it is taking containers to the mainstream.,N/A,-1,-1
Each one of these three container-focussed companies gives VMware a big boost to one day having containers and virtual machines coexist in harmony in all areas of virtualization.,N/A,-1,-1
"During a press conference after the keynote, Gelsinger explained that while there has been a lot of excitement around containers, enterprises are hesitant to change their underlying infrastructure to accommodate them.",N/A,-1,-1
"With Project Marvin, VMware hopes to appease developers who are attracted to the container trend while also supporting enterprises who don t want to jump to a new type of IT infrastructure.",Marvin,2,2
Gelsinger likened this to how it is integrating with OpenStack to placate developers.,N/A,-1,-1
Docker CEO Ben Golub said that he has quickly seen Docker go from a tool being used by developers to being embraced by system administrators and he is even seeing some large banks and government institutions deploying containers as well.,N/A,-1,-1
The partnership with VMware is a way to bring containers to people who are accustomed to VMware environments.,N/A,-1,-1
"You can develop in agile and use all the micro services you want, but you can still deploy around the fifteen-plus years of management experience you get from VMware,  said Golub.",N/A,-1,-1
"Craig McLuckie, a Google product manager, said that Google has also been using containers and virtual machines together and that the two technologies synced up provides a level of security not found in using containers alone.",Craig,0,0

"The new Skip won t be a clip, either.",N/A,-1,-1
"Instead, it s more likely a key fob, according to Droid Life, which published detailed information about the device on Monday.",N/A,-1,-1
"The fob will have a replaceable coin-style battery and, like last year s sticker, will keep your phone unlocked when nearby.",N/A,-1,-1
Think of Skip as a trusted device for a Motorola phone: When the fob moves out of Bluetooth range from the phone   or vice versa   your phone will securely lock and require a PIN to be used.,N/A,-1,-1

How s this for a twist: Amazon has agreed to acquire video game live streaming site Twitch in a deal valued at almost $1 billion.,N/A,-1,-1
the news was first reported Monday morning by the Information and the Wall Street Journal.,Wall,12,12
"The acquisition would be a big get for Amazon, and a notable upset for Google, which had been in talks to buy Twitch for $1 billion in May.",N/A,-1,-1
"Rumors about Google s deal to acquire Twitch and integrate it into YouTube had been bubbling up over the summer, but the Journal reported Monday that the talks between the two companies  cooled in recent weeks.",N/A,-1,-1
"Meanwhile, Twitch has been preparing itself for an acquisition with the closure of its Justin.tv live streaming service as well as the introduction of copyright filters for music on Twitch.tv.",Justin,15,15
"Twitch may be an unknown for many mainstream consumers, but the site does an impressive business streaming video gameplay much like a sports league streams sporting events like football or soccer.",N/A,-1,-1
According to the Amazon release last month more than 55 million unique visitors viewed more than 15 billion minutes of content on Twitch produced by more than 1 million broadcasters.,N/A,-1,-1
"The deal makes sense for Amazon which is both a growing streaming video provider looking for entertainment options, and could also be a good place to advertise its growing array of products and services.",N/A,-1,-1
According to the Amazon press release the retailer will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Twitch for approximately $970 million in cash.,N/A,-1,-1

The consolidation in the broadband market that would take place with the Comcast merger could exacerbate a status quo in which many Americans have little or no choice in internet service providers.",N/A,-1,-1
"While Comcast has pointed to emerging  alternatives  like Google Fiber, these are hardly widespread and, as the Wall Street Journal reports, their business strategy relies on only offering service in places where it is easy and profitable to do so.",Wall,19,19
"This means that many people will have to depend on Comcast, which recently won another  golden poo  award for its customer service, to deliver essential internet.",N/A,-1,-1
"The lack of choice among ISP s, however, is only one of two major issues that should give the FCC pause in approving the deal.",N/A,-1,-1
"The other is the demise of  net neutrality  rules, which forbid broadband providers from favoring some types of internet content over another.",N/A,-1,-1

"Facebook defines clickbait as  when a publisher posts a link with a headline that encourages people to click to see more, without telling them much information about what they will see.",N/A,-1,-1
"In the blog post announcing the news, Facebook used a picture with the below announcement:

Clickbait posts are the junk food of content consumption: They provide just enough information sans substance to make you want more.",N/A,-1,-1
"Facebook said in the blog post that although clickbait titles see high engagement, that doesn t mean users like them.",N/A,-1,-1
"When we asked people in an initial survey what type of content they preferred to see in their News Feeds, 80 percent of the time people preferred headlines that helped them decide if they wanted to read the full article before they had to click through,  the company said.",N/A,-1,-1
"Instead of combing the headline text for  clickbait triggers,  Facebook is taking a different approach to weeding out clickbait.",N/A,-1,-1

"The term  open journalism,  which has become a core principle of digital media for forward-thinking outlets such as The Guardian newspaper in Britain, is often used to mean journalism that engages with its audience (or  the people formerly known as the audience  as Jay Rosen calls them) and allows them to contribute to the process.",Jay,46,46
But the idea of opening up journalism is also about what media companies can do beyond just producing articles or facts for people to consume   and a big part of that is opening up the data behind their stories.,N/A,-1,-1

"And for those interested in open journalism, it provides the same kinds of access for data that emerges from reporting projects like the New York Times story.",New York,24,25
"As the Source post notes, the Times got the data for its map and associated story from the Pentagon, based on a request for information about all the transfers of equipment that the U.S. military had made to domestic police forces since 2006, and it posted the entire data repository to Github for others to use.",N/A,-1,-1
"A member of the NYT editorial team said that after publishing the map, the newspaper had gotten a number of requests from other media outlets looking for access to the numbers behind it, and Github seemed like the easiest way to provide it   and a number of newspapers have already used the data for their own stories on the phenomenon.",N/A,-1,-1
"Team member Tom Giratikanon noted that another major benefit of opening data up in this way is that it can be checked for errors (which someone started doing not long after it was posted), but that the flip-side of that is errors can also be introduced accidentally:

The Knight-Mozilla blog also describes how BuzzFeed took the data behind a story it did on racial segregation in Missouri and posted it to Github, along with the code that the outlet used to generate the numbers from census data and other publicly-available information.",Missouri,70,70
"And Jeremy Singer-Vine of BuzzFeed told the Source blog why he thinks being as transparent as possible about such projects is important because it allows for a number of related benefits, including:

Verifiability: Readers or other media outlets should be able to check sources and code or math for any obvious mistakes.",N/A,-1,-1
Reproducibility: Readers and/or news entities should be able to conduct the same analysis and see if they get the same results.,N/A,-1,-1

"But at what point does the human eye fail to distinguish between ever-increasing resolutions 

According to LG s chief research engineer Lim Min-ho, speaking to the Wall Street Journal, the increased resolution of the G3 is noticeable because its target customers   men and women in their 20s and 30s   hold their smartphones at a  distance of 20 to 25 centimeters.",Wall,27,27

One of the main differences between Motorola s Google Android Wear watch and the Samsung Gear Live as well as LG s own initial G Watch is the circular face.,N/A,-1,-1
Google designed the Android Wear software to work with either square or round displays.,N/A,-1,-1
"It s difficult to tell from the video but the G Watch R   I assume the R stands for  round    will have a full circular display, which could slightly differentiate it from the Moto 360.",N/A,-1,-1
Motorola s watch does have a round screen but a small slice of the bottom is actually used for the display cabling so the screen will not show completely round images.,N/A,-1,-1
LG s G Watch R appears at this point to overcome that design challenge.,N/A,-1,-1
It may seem odd that LG is already planning its second Android Wear watch when the first model only went on sale this past June for $229.,N/A,-1,-1
But LG was actually the primary hardware maker that worked directly with Google as the search company created Android Wear software.,N/A,-1,-1

"Of course, VMware s Integrated OpenStack doesn t necessarily mean that VMware is pushing customers to use  OpenStack.",N/A,-1,-1
"As John Gilmartin, VP and GM of VMware s software defined data center suite business unit, explained in an interview, while VMware is accommodating customer demand on behalf of developers who are building applications made to scale out across multiple clouds, VMware is still touting its approach to the software defined data center as the way to go.",N/A,-1,-1
"It s interesting to note that the whole concept of OpenStack from its inception was to provide an alternative to the VMware private cloud and the Amazon public cloud, and VMware s Integrated OpenStack seems to counter the notion of OpenStack purists who would rather have a private cloud built on top of multiple open source components like Ceph or Swift storage or the KVM hypervisor.",Swift,61,61

"Mark Bowker, a senior analyst for the Enterprise Strategy Group, describes VMware s project as a simplified software approach to VMware s take on software defined data centers that s bundled into hardware and made really easy for administrators to  plug it in and turn it on and get it going.",Enterprise,8,8
"If this sounds familiar, that s because there are several startups like Nutanix, Simplivity and 2014 Structure s People s Choice Launchpad winner Nimboxx, that all sell their own data center appliances that contain all the necessary ingredients of compute, storage and networking into one package.",N/A,-1,-1
"While some of those third party bundles started out supporting VMware s ESX hypervisor, they ve added support for rival hypervisors likely because they started to see VMware as more a competitor than a partner.",N/A,-1,-1
"The new VMware-certified appliance, naturally, is in the ESX camp.",N/A,-1,-1
"While VMware s Van Der Walt acknowledges the similarities between the new appliance and those sold by VMware s partners, he said that there has been some concern in the industry regarding how new those startups are and their overall longevity in the marketplace.",N/A,-1,-1
"When VMware first pitched the idea to customers, Van Der Walt said, they were excited with the idea and told VMware that it should  have done this long a time ago.",N/A,-1,-1
"Clearly, these new machines will not be used to do Google-style workloads but will be most likely used by shops that want to set up a remote office or branch office backend that exists outside their main data centers, said Bowker.",N/A,-1,-1
"The plug-and-play nature of the box coupled with VMware s simplified and easy to understand virtual desktop interface will essentially validate the software defined approach to leveraging  more off-the-shelf-hardware components,  he said.",N/A,-1,-1
"It will shed light that not every data center needs a highly specialized SAN environment,  said Bowker.",N/A,-1,-1
"According to Chris Wolf, CTO of Americas for VMware, the new converged hardware will also help private cloud providers get  public cloud economies.",N/A,-1,-1
"VMware s cloud provider partners can run on EVO:Rail, but they will not be required to do so.",N/A,-1,-1

Sony s PlayStation Network is back up and running after a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that overwhelmed its servers.,N/A,-1,-1
"The company said in a blog post early Monday that, despite the attack, it had  seen no evidence of any intrusion to the network and no evidence of any unauthorized access to users  personal information.",N/A,-1,-1
"So this isn t a repeat of the big PlayStation Network breaches of 2011, which saw the theft of personal details of millions of users.",N/A,-1,-1
"Sony said in its post that it would forgo scheduled network maintenance that had been scheduled for Monday, and apologized to its users for the inconvenience of the downtime.",N/A,-1,-1
"In DDoS attacks, the attackers flood the target s servers with data until they can no longer cope, either disrupting or outright killing the service they re providing.",N/A,-1,-1
It seems there may be a link between the PlayStation Network DDoS and a Sunday bomb threat that diverted an American Airlines flight carrying Sony Online Entertainment chief John Smedley.,N/A,-1,-1
"A Twitter account belonging to  Lizard Squad  made the threat, specifically referring to Smedley, and also suggested that whoever is behind the account was also directing the DDoS attack.",N/A,-1,-1
"The motive, apparently, is Sony s alleged lack of investment in the PlayStation Network:",N/A,-1,-1
"Most people are only familiar with the  big five  web browsers   Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari and Opera.",N/A,-1,-1
But there are hundreds of other browsers out there.,N/A,-1,-1
"Most alternative browsers are remade versions of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Internet Explorer.",N/A,-1,-1
"Chrome itself is built on Chromium, an open-source browser project; Firefox is also open-source.",N/A,-1,-1
"That means that any developer can take the code, add or remove some parts of it and release a completely new browser.",N/A,-1,-1
"Why do that, though  The  big five  browsers are already highly customizable.",N/A,-1,-1
"Chrome and Firefox have particularly large libraries of extensions, but generally, you can tailor most browsers to your particular needs.",N/A,-1,-1
"Nevertheless, a large percentage of users may never have visited the Chrome Web Store or gone into Firefox s Add-ons section.",N/A,-1,-1
Some alternative browsers can provide additional functionality for people who don t want to bother with installing add-ons or don t know how to do it.,N/A,-1,-1
"Meanwhile, more advanced users who know what they need and can t get it through installing more add-ons can search for browsers that might solve their problems.",N/A,-1,-1
"Here are some alternative browsers that might be worth your attention, based on what you need from this kind of software.",N/A,-1,-1
You don t have to abandon your primary browser and completely switch to an alternative.,N/A,-1,-1
"Nothing prevents you from keeping a second or even a third browser for bank-related activity, media downloading or online gaming.",N/A,-1,-1
Privacy-based browsers are probably the largest category of alternative browsers.,N/A,-1,-1
"Whether you are concerned about the NSA spying scandal, want to avoid advertising companies collecting your data or conduct financial operations online, you might want a browser that doesn t collect any private data.",N/A,-1,-1
WhiteHat Aviator blocks holes through which most malicious sites infect your computer.,N/A,-1,-1
It cuts out all ads and disables the media autoplay.,N/A,-1,-1
"This way, nothing on a website you visit can launch without your permission.",N/A,-1,-1
"By default, Aviator opens in Incognito mode and removes all traces of your online activity when you close it.",N/A,-1,-1
"On top of that, Aviator uses the DuckDuckGo search engine by default   a privacy-focused service that  doesn t link search activity to a user.",N/A,-1,-1
"Dozens of browsers and applications claim that they can speed up downloads, but only a few actually produce noticeable results.",N/A,-1,-1
Citrio is one of them.,N/A,-1,-1
"Besides being a browser, Citrio has many additional features, like an integrated bit-torrent client, proxy switcher, video saver and a download manager.",N/A,-1,-1
"The latter is what deserves attention: the download manager not only allows you to resume interrupted or paused downloads, but also speeds them up.",N/A,-1,-1
"Depending on where you download from, you may see a boost between two and five times times your usual speed.",N/A,-1,-1
"This isn t the only working download accelerator, but it gives noticeable results.",N/A,-1,-1
"If you re running a low-end machine or have decided to infuse a second life into an old laptop, you ve probably noticed that browsers tend to occupy lots of RAM.",N/A,-1,-1
"Maybe you don t need all those fancy extensions, Facebook integration and tons of online services.",N/A,-1,-1
"If you need your browser solely for web research, email and a little social media, Midori will satisfy your humble needs without slowing down your PC.",N/A,-1,-1
"Midori actually originates from Linux, but there is also a Windows version.",N/A,-1,-1
"Not too much to say here: Midori is simple as you would expect, offering tabbed browsing, search, bookmarks, speed dial and some basic extensions (disabled by default).",N/A,-1,-1
So it doesn t have much to occupy your RAM with.,N/A,-1,-1
The simple interface contributes to a lightweight browsing experience without the IE 6 feel so common among other light browsers.,N/A,-1,-1
"If you like playing simple web-based games and want to gain an advantage in them, Coowon is a browser that can spice up your gaming experience.",N/A,-1,-1
Coowon is designed with online gaming in mind.,N/A,-1,-1
"It offers multiple separate windows to log in to different game accounts, gamepad support for your Logitech or Xbox controller and a  Boss  key to immediately hide the games and pretend that you re working.",N/A,-1,-1
"Coowon also increases in-game speed, so if a game makes you wait through several hour for a particular event to happen, you can just fast forward ahead and save your time.",N/A,-1,-1
"Researching a topic online usually requires browsing through dozens of sites, clicking on every link the search engine provides you with just to peek inside and see what s there.",N/A,-1,-1
"If this is a common situation for you, then there is an interesting alternative.",N/A,-1,-1
"Okay, so technically SpaceTime3D isn t a browser.",N/A,-1,-1
"Rather, it s an application (also available for web) that lets you preview all the pages that Google has found.",N/A,-1,-1
"Instead of clicking on each separate link, you can scroll through all the sites, previewing them and learning about their content.",N/A,-1,-1
Is it original  Yes.,N/A,-1,-1
Does this increase your productivity  Try it and see for yourself.,N/A,-1,-1
A lot of people just love Firefox.,N/A,-1,-1
"Aliens, meanwhile, are probably using the Alienforce browser.",N/A,-1,-1
"Alienforce is basically nothing more than your usual Firefox, save for some cosmetic upgrades.",N/A,-1,-1
"Though it claims to speed up your browsing, that effect is hardly noticeable.",N/A,-1,-1
But Alienforce can give you some mixed extraterrestrial feeling of Firefox and Opera thanks to its interface layout and tabbed browsing.,N/A,-1,-1
"If you believe that the truth is out there, then you ll like this browser.",N/A,-1,-1
Device lock-in is a term often thrown about.,N/A,-1,-1
"For example, one of the criticisms I often hear about Apple is you ll be  locked into their ecosystem.",N/A,-1,-1
"The implication being if you buy an Apple/Android/Whatever phone, getting off that platform will be difficult.",N/A,-1,-1
"The fact is, lots of things in our lives have lock-in.",N/A,-1,-1
"I buy Gillette razors, so I m locked into that brand.",Gillette,2,2
"I have a Keurig coffee maker, so I m locked into K-cups.",N/A,-1,-1
"I also have Apple and Android devices, so I have some lock-in to those two brands.",N/A,-1,-1
"Granted, it s cheaper to move away from my razors than a smartphone.",N/A,-1,-1
"Still, there are steps you can take to make switching devices a little easier.",N/A,-1,-1
Throughout this article I will talk about the different types of lock-in you ll experience with your mobile devices and how to minimize the hassle if you swap platforms.,N/A,-1,-1
"The bulk of the time when I m working on something, it s on an Apple device.",N/A,-1,-1
"I have a MacBook Pro, and iPad 3 and an iPhone 5.",N/A,-1,-1
"My Android Nexus 7 tablet sees some use, and a distant last is my Kindle.",N/A,-1,-1
The biggest lock-in for me is in apps.,N/A,-1,-1
"This is pretty normal, and would happen regardless of the platform I m on.",N/A,-1,-1
Even my work laptop has some lock-in with Microsoft Visio.,N/A,-1,-1
"The apps I primarily use on my iOS devices are Microsoft Word and Excel, Pages and Numbers, Byword, Kindle, Music/iTunes, Positive Grid JamUP, Twitter and Pocket.",Excel,13,13
"On my Android devices I use Kindle, Twitter, and the Arkham Horror Companion (an app that handles some of the cards for the board game Arkham Horror.",N/A,-1,-1
"There is an iOS version of an Arkham Horror Toolkit, but I prefer the Android version because it s a little easier to use and includes the cards for all of the expansions.",N/A,-1,-1
"If we accept as a given that lock-in is almost impossible to avoid, I have a few guidelines to try to minimize the impact.",N/A,-1,-1
"While the apps are going to be specific to the platform, my main goal is to select apps where the data resides outside the app in a cloud service I can access from any app.",N/A,-1,-1
"Byword, for example, uses Dropbox to store its files.",N/A,-1,-1
"If the app doesn t allow the data outside of its comfy little silo, my second guideline is the app should be cross-platform.",N/A,-1,-1
"The Kindle app is available for most devices, as is Comixology.",N/A,-1,-1
"I have a lot of magazines in Zinio, and, again it s cross-platform.",N/A,-1,-1
Apps like iWork fall into a gray area for me.,N/A,-1,-1
"While the file format is proprietary, it s unlikely I ll be moving completely away from Apple for a long time.",N/A,-1,-1
"That said, if that happens, the files can be exported as text files, and the web apps are available as well.",N/A,-1,-1
"While I use OmniFocus for my task management program, my actual task-tracking needs are pretty basic and can be easily recreated in a different platform if I needed to.",N/A,-1,-1
I ve given some thought to moving to a Google tasks-based system so I can have access to my tasks on Android.,N/A,-1,-1
"Since iBooks are only available on Apple devices, I don t buy many of them.",N/A,-1,-1
"Unless a book I want is only available through the iBookstore, I ll buy it elsewhere.",N/A,-1,-1
"I d also have to really want the book, too.",N/A,-1,-1
"So far, I ve only bought a few songbooks and an iOS programming book on iBooks.",N/A,-1,-1
"The way I have things set up now, while I m locked into some vendors (Amazon being the largest), the actual platform that I use the apps on I m fairly confident I could migrate off of if I needed to.",N/A,-1,-1
"If you re going to migrate off a device platform, the first recommendation is to make sure the reason you re moving away from a platform isn t fixable.",N/A,-1,-1
Googling some of the frustrations you re having might yield some solutions.,N/A,-1,-1
Or it could frustrate you even more; the internet is funny that way.,N/A,-1,-1
"If you re moving from an iPhone to an Android device, it s important to make sure you deactivate and sign out of iMessage (and all iCloud services, for that matter).",N/A,-1,-1
"If you don t, bad things like not getting your text messages might happen.",N/A,-1,-1
Moving data from individual apps is best handled through a Cloud service like Dropbox if the app supports it.,N/A,-1,-1
One nice thing about iCloud Drive in iOS 8 is you ll be able to access your app s iCloud data from your Mac or PC.,N/A,-1,-1
The biggest obstacle for me if I migrate to a new platform is my Music library.,N/A,-1,-1
I use iTunes Match.,N/A,-1,-1
"iTunes, of course, is not available on other mobile platforms.",N/A,-1,-1
"Google Play, however, is available on multiple platforms.",N/A,-1,-1
"However, moving your music from iTunes to Google may not be a one-step process.",N/A,-1,-1
This article does a decent job of outlining how to use Google Play Music Manager to upload your music to Google.,N/A,-1,-1
"If you have all of your music downloaded already, it will handle the upload easily.",N/A,-1,-1
"However, if like me, you don t download much music and instead use a service like iTunes Match, you might have to download the music before using Google Play Music Manager.",N/A,-1,-1
"The biggest fear I have is that a large company like Amazon will go out of the ebook business, or shut down.",N/A,-1,-1
"This isn t likely to happen, and fortunately, some of their books are sold without DRM so I can archive them.",N/A,-1,-1
"Similarly, Comixology also makes some titles available for download without DRM.",N/A,-1,-1
"However, I used to use Fictionwise for my ebooks purchases and they are no longer around.",N/A,-1,-1
"I was, however, able to remove the DRM on my purchases before they went under.",N/A,-1,-1
"Like it or not, lock-in is something we have to deal with on our digital devices.",N/A,-1,-1
Companies have little incentive to make it easy to use their data outside of their infrastructure.,N/A,-1,-1
"If you are dealing with data that exports cleanly, like a text file, you ll be able to use your data on multiple devices easily.",N/A,-1,-1
It s important to pick your battles with lock-in.,N/A,-1,-1
"In my case, I try to minimize lock-in to a specific device manager, but cave on being locked-into a vendor like Amazon.",N/A,-1,-1
Add Pivotal to the list of tech players adding mobile services to its development platform.,N/A,-1,-1
"Last week, the company announced Pivotal CF Mobile Services   which aims to enable developers to build push notifications into their applications; an API gateway to let them incorporate an array of third-party services; and data synchronization to give those apps access to lots of data types.",Mobile,8,8
"The service, which builds on the Pivotal acquisition of Xtreme Labs last year, will be available sometime this quarter.",N/A,-1,-1
"Since mobile-first development now is the rule of the land, every company that offers a development platform is scrambling to add   or acquire   services that help developers build smartphone or tablet apps more easily.",N/A,-1,-1
"As Gigaom reported last week, any major IT player that has not already done so will likely outline its mobile dev plan sooner rather than later.",N/A,-1,-1

Always a good interview, Box CEO and Co-founder Aaron Levie was a good sport again this week   subjecting himself to questions about the company s planned IPO and ability to joust with giants on this week s show.",N/A,-1,-1
Cliff Notes version: Box is about more than file share-and-sync and suits companies that don t want to lock into one software provider or OS.,N/A,-1,-1
Levie s segment starts at about minute 14.,N/A,-1,-1
"For the past few weeks I ve been using a 6.1-inch Android handset with HD screen, a quad-core processor, LTE support and 13 megapixel camera.",N/A,-1,-1
It s packed with features and has a battery that can last for days.,N/A,-1,-1
"Here s the best part: The Huawei Ascend Mate2 costs $299.99 without a contract and works on either AT&T or T-Mobile in the U.S.

Look at an off-contract flagship phone these days and you can expect to pay $600 or more, so the Huawei Ascend Mate2 is 50 percent or more less expensive.",Mobile,25,25
"Then again, while the phone has plenty of good features, it s not a flagship phone if you first look at the chip powering the device.",N/A,-1,-1
"Huawei chose a 1.6 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 for the Ascend Mate2, which in terms of silicon is a bit dated as the chip debuted in early 2013.",N/A,-1,-1
"I rarely felt that the phone was lacking for performance, however.",N/A,-1,-1
"With its 2 GB of memory, it fluidly runs Google Android 4.3 with Huawei s EMUI 2.0 Lite skin, which is aptly named: It s fairly light when compared to very busy Android skins from other manufacturers.",N/A,-1,-1
"There s no app drawer though, which irked me a bit; instead, all apps are installed to the home screens.",N/A,-1,-1
"I also see some influence from Samsung s TouchWiz; mainly in the notification shade and settings but for the most part, Huawei s software is pretty innocuous atop Android.",N/A,-1,-1
"Even when running multiple applications, the Ascend Mate2 keeps chugging along.",N/A,-1,-1
"No, it s not  flagship fast  but it s not flagship priced, either.",N/A,-1,-1
"For most typical users, there s more than enough power here.",N/A,-1,-1
"How many mainstream users want a 6.1-inch handset, however 

There s no easy answer to that question and there s no way to hide the fact that this is a big phone.",N/A,-1,-1
"But it s about as small, light and thin as you could make a large handset.",N/A,-1,-1
Huawei has minimized the bezel all around the screen so most of the front face is that 720p screen.,N/A,-1,-1
"The phone is all plastic, save for the Gorilla Glass 3 screen, which is bright and relatively crisp.",N/A,-1,-1
And that plastic keeps the weight down: The Ascend Mate2 weighs just 202 grams even though it measures in at 6.3 x 3.3 x 0.37 inches.,N/A,-1,-1
All of this keeps the phone feeling smaller than you d think when envisioning a 6.1-inch phone.,N/A,-1,-1
"Make no mistake though: This is a two-handed model, just like a tablet would be.",N/A,-1,-1
It s too big for my tastes   and my pants pockets too.,N/A,-1,-1
Get past that though and the Ascend Mate2 could keep you from carrying or buying both a phone and a separate tablet.,N/A,-1,-1
"This phone definitely has better cameras than most tablets, of course.",N/A,-1,-1
There s a 13 megapixel rear sensor with LED flash and a 5 megapixel camera on the front.,N/A,-1,-1
"Huawei chose a backlit Sony camera sensor on the back, with an f/2.2 aperture.",N/A,-1,-1
"Photos look better than you d expect for a $300 phone, particularly in dim scenarios where the wide aperture gulps in light.",N/A,-1,-1
"There are modes for HDR shots, Panoramas and a few others that again remind me of Samsung s software: Beauty mode and Sound & shot, for example.",Beauty,21,21
Although it s easy to dub the Mate2 a  mid-range phone  it has some advanced features including some that take advantage of the large screen.,N/A,-1,-1
You can run some small apps while running other things using what Huawei calls the optional W.O.W.,N/A,-1,-1
button.,N/A,-1,-1
Tap it and you ll get a few app options such as a pop-up calendar app; helpful while reading emails for example.,N/A,-1,-1
There s also a Gloves Mode so you can use the phone during those cold winters.,N/A,-1,-1
And Motion Control adds some simple but effective ways to mute a call or reduce the phone s ringer simply by flipping the phone over or picking it up.,N/A,-1,-1
"The phone also supports Bluetooth 4.0 LE so it works with wearable devices, and 802.11ac Wi-Fi networks.",N/A,-1,-1
It only comes with 16 GB of storage but you can expand that with a microSD card.,N/A,-1,-1
Perhaps the best feature of all is the battery life.,N/A,-1,-1
"Thanks to its large size, the Mate2 has plenty of room for the 3,900 mAh battery.",N/A,-1,-1
Even a power user would have a hard time running this power pack down in a full day.,N/A,-1,-1
"I ve been able to eke out nearly two full days of moderate use, for example.",N/A,-1,-1
That s actually a benefit to having a lower-powered processor as well: It takes less juice to power the chip inside the phone.,N/A,-1,-1
"To be clear, there are arguably more capable handsets on the market today.",N/A,-1,-1
"If you want one, expect to pay twice as much money at full price, however.",N/A,-1,-1
"For the money, Huawei s Ascend Mate2 is spectacular value, combining a generous display with capable performance and battery life that s unparalleled by any smartphone I ve ever used.",N/A,-1,-1
Are there limitations here  Of course.,N/A,-1,-1
"If you re willing to accept them though, you ll be surprised by how happy a $299 phone purchase can make you.",N/A,-1,-1
Samsung s original Chromebook cemented the company s status in the market early on but it s a different market now.,N/A,-1,-1
"Acer has recently taken the Chromebook sales crown, at least in the most recent quarter, and there are far more Chromebooks running on alternatives to Samsung s Exynos chips.",N/A,-1,-1
Intel processors are found in many Chromebooks and HP looks to be switching from a Samsung chip in its next model.,N/A,-1,-1
Acer is starting to sell non-Intel Chromebooks for the first time ever but it too is choosing an alternative to Samsung with Nvidia s Tegra K1 in the Acer Chromebook 13.,N/A,-1,-1

",N/A,-1,-1
"Last week, I spoke with a well-known specialty retailer.",N/A,-1,-1
"They briefed me on the company s omnichannel marketing program, then asked for help finding a  really cutting-edge technology to really define our mobile commerce strategy.",N/A,-1,-1
A few things struck me when I heard that.,N/A,-1,-1
"First, in a trip back to Business 101, your marketing strategy is your commerce strategy.",N/A,-1,-1
You hitch your transactions to the product pitch   not the other way around.,N/A,-1,-1
"Transactions are just about closing the loop, and the combination of buttons versus users trying to click to seal the deal won t convert any transactions on its own.",N/A,-1,-1
"Second (and perhaps more concerning), is that after all the work a company has put into a really comprehensive outbound marketing program, it isn t looking for a gimmick to captivate users into buying.",N/A,-1,-1
I get it.,N/A,-1,-1
"Retailers, banks, and consumers all want frictionless transactions, and nobody wants to be the tragically unhip company that can t meet its users on their terms.",N/A,-1,-1
"But let s put things in perspective: There are countless ways to allow users to transact on their mobile devices, and some are certainly more elegant and efficient than others.",N/A,-1,-1
"Technology, however, is not a strategy, and while a lousy checkout can definitely lose a sale, a good one is rarely the reason a consumer decides to buy.",N/A,-1,-1
Mobile commerce  is a bit of a rabbit hole.,Mobile,0,0
As a concept it makes sense to look at all the ways in which users will transact on their mobile devices.,N/A,-1,-1
But mobile commerce encompasses a number of entirely different spaces.,N/A,-1,-1
"A Square-enabled mobile POS, a video game offering in-app purchases, FeLiCa s tap-to-pay system at train stations, and a retailer s mobile-enabled website all fit the criteria, but there s very little overlap.",N/A,-1,-1
"The spectrum of mobile commerce into can be divided into six distinct areas:

The trick with mobile commerce is treating it as a checkbox rather than a top-level strategy.",N/A,-1,-1
"Users must be able to transact on their phones, one way or another   that s a given.",N/A,-1,-1
But the how of it is determined by the marketing strategy and customer experience.,N/A,-1,-1
"The correct method may not necessarily fit your competitors, and that s OK.

App engagement is up but the number of apps with which users interact has plateaued.",N/A,-1,-1
"In that world, Facebook has the scale and stickiness to create its own payment system, but few others share that luxury.",N/A,-1,-1
"Social game developers might look to Facebook credits as a payment option that could work across devices, while a business like Lyft, whose success depends entirely on its app, can focus on third-party mobile-only payments like Google Wallet.",N/A,-1,-1
"Starbucks built its own mobile commerce platform as an extension to its existing infrastructure, bringing transactions, loyalty points to the phone in a simple, straightforward package that both complemented and mirrored its offline experience.",N/A,-1,-1
"As Kristina Yee writes in a forthcoming Gigaom Research report, these proprietary  closed ecosystems  will gain ground, despite a complete lack of standardization.",N/A,-1,-1
"At the same time, most of the world s retailers lack Starbucks  lock-in, and for those companies, a more lightweight mobile commerce channels may be more appropriate.",N/A,-1,-1
A properly tuned mobile front-end to an existing Web-based commerce engine may be more than sufficient to service users needs.,N/A,-1,-1
"If it can leverage a user s existing stored credentials (like an Amazon or Google storefront), the Web-based solution may save time and headaches for customers and developers.",N/A,-1,-1
"Mobile commerce is an important part of any retailer s strategy, but it isn t a strategy in itself.",Mobile,0,0
"It s always a good idea to keep an eye on what s new (and we re happy to help our clients do that), but if we focus on the business case first, the technology choices will be obvious.",N/A,-1,-1
"Just a decade ago, the web was in the midst of transforming consumer behavior through e-commerce, online banking and information discovery.",N/A,-1,-1
Now the internet is shifting users  psyches again   this time through the Internet of Things (IoT).,N/A,-1,-1
"Starting with home automation and wearable technology (Google Glass, Nest, Apple HomeKit), IoT is on the cusp of pervading other facets of consumer life and industries.",N/A,-1,-1
"Even if IoT is the next big thing, various hurdles must be overcome before society can coexist with massively ubiquitous, intelligently connected devices.",N/A,-1,-1
"Important questions revolving around security and safety need to be addressed before widespread adoption can take place; even with current home IoT products, such as smart thermostats and lighting, privacy and security issues abound.",N/A,-1,-1
Smart locks   smartphone and/or app-controlled door locks   are a particularly interesting example.,N/A,-1,-1
"Though various smart lock products have been on the market for some time now, consumers have been relatively slow to adopt the technology and that s understandable.",N/A,-1,-1
"Before trading the security of the traditional lock-and-key combo for the convenience of a smart lock, consumers have to be convinced that these locks are valuable enough to enable them to overcome insecurities and reservations.",N/A,-1,-1
Here are some of the key features that may be required to move smart locks into the mainstream.,N/A,-1,-1
The front door is all that separates one s home from the outside world.,N/A,-1,-1
"Subsequently, potential smart lock adopters are overwhelmingly concerned with the inherent dangers of digitization.",N/A,-1,-1
"What if a hacker spots a smart lock secured home, and is able to compromise its security  What if smartphone access to the smart lock fails, either via user error or a software bug  Smart lock products should look like standard locks so as not to draw unwanted attention, and in the event that smartphone or app control is lost, the smart lock must allow for operation with a standard key as a fall-back measure.",N/A,-1,-1
Many home owners regard their houses as extensions of themselves.,Many,0,0
Smart lock products must allow for simple customization of look and feel to match the d cor and trimmings of the structure or building.,N/A,-1,-1
"The smart lock must be as easier to install than a standard lock (with no perceived need for a locksmith) , and as easy to use as a conventional lock and key combo any number of people, with varying technical proficiency, may require access (e.g., the janitor, housekeeper, or grandma).",N/A,-1,-1
"As IoT devices, smart locks should go above and beyond merely replacing a standard lock and key.",N/A,-1,-1
"Connectivity should expand and enhance their functionality features such as access monitoring and logging to the cloud, remote unlocking via the web and other unique, internet-enabled capabilities should be available.",N/A,-1,-1
"In parallel to the benefits of being connected, communications and data transmission must also be secure and encrypted.",N/A,-1,-1
"Furthermore, as mission-critical electronic devices, smart locks must use batteries with extensive lives, and perhaps allow for some alternate forms of charging such as solar or kinetic motion.",N/A,-1,-1
"Again, as a new alternative to an age-old contraption, the smart lock should provide consumers with enough incentives and value propositions to leave the conventional lock and key combo behind.",N/A,-1,-1

"As big data applications move from proof-of-concept to production, resiliency becomes an urgent concern.",N/A,-1,-1
"When applications lack resiliency, they may fail when data sets are too large, they lack transparency into testing and operations, and they are insecure.",N/A,-1,-1
"As a result, defects must be fixed after applications are in production, which wastes time and money.",N/A,-1,-1
"The solution is to start by building resilient applications: robust, tested, changeable, auditable, secure, performant, and monitorable.",N/A,-1,-1
This is a matter of philosophy and architecture as much as technology.,N/A,-1,-1
Here are the key dimensions of resiliency that I recommend for anyone building big data apps.,N/A,-1,-1
The first step is to create a systemic enterprise architecture and methodology for how your company approaches big data applications.,N/A,-1,-1
"What data are you after  What kinds of analytics are most important  How will metrics, auditing, security and operational features be built in  Can you prove that all data was processed  These capabilities must be built into the architecture.",N/A,-1,-1
"Other questions to consider: What technology will be crucial  What technology is being used as a matter of convenience  Your blueprint must include honest, accurate assessments of where your current architecture is failing.",N/A,-1,-1
"Keep in mind that a resilient framework for building big data applications may take time to assemble, but is definitely worth it.",N/A,-1,-1
"If an application fails when it attempts to tackle larger datasets, it is not resilient.",N/A,-1,-1
"Often, applications are tested with small-scale datasets and then fail or take far too long with larger ones.",N/A,-1,-1
"To be resilient, applications must handle datasets of any size (and the size of the dataset in the case of your application may mean depth, width, rate of ingestion, or all of the above).",N/A,-1,-1
Applications must also adapt to new technologies.,N/A,-1,-1
"Otherwise, companies are constantly reconfiguring, rebuilding and recoding.",N/A,-1,-1
"Obviously, this wastes time, resources and money.",N/A,-1,-1
"With complicated applications, chasing down scaling and other resiliency problems is far from automated.",N/A,-1,-1
"Ideally, it should be easy to see how long each step in a complicated pipeline takes so that problems can be caught and fixed right away.",N/A,-1,-1
"It is critical to pinpoint where the problem is: in the code, the data, the infrastructure, or the network.",N/A,-1,-1
But this type of transparency shouldn t have to be constructed for each application; it should be a part of a larger platform so that developers and operations staff can diagnose and respond to problems as they arise.,N/A,-1,-1
"Once you find a problem, it is vital to relate the application behavior to the code   ideally through the same monitoring application that reported the error.",N/A,-1,-1
"Too often, getting access to code involves consulting multiple developers and following a winding chain of custody.",N/A,-1,-1
"Resilient applications tend to be future-proof because they employ abstractions that simplify development, improve productivity and allow substitution of implementation technology.",N/A,-1,-1
"As part of the architecture, technology should allow developers to build applications without miring them in the implementation details.",N/A,-1,-1
This type of simplicity allows any data scientist to use the application and access any type of data source.,N/A,-1,-1
"Without such abstractions, productivity suffers, changes are more expensive and users drown in complexity.",N/A,-1,-1
"A resilient application comes with its own audit trail, one that shows who used the application, who is allowed to use it, what data was accessed and how policies were enforced.",N/A,-1,-1
"Building these capabilities into applications is the key to meeting the ever-increasing array of privacy, security, governance and control challenges and regulations that businesses face with big data

To be resilient, applications have to prove they have not lost data.",N/A,-1,-1
Failing to do so can lead to dramatic consequences.,N/A,-1,-1
"For instance, as I witnessed during my time in financial services, fines and charges of money laundering or fraud can result if a company fails to account for every transaction because the application code missed one or two lines of data.",N/A,-1,-1
"Execution analysis, audit trails and test-driven development are foundational to proving that all the data was processed properly.",N/A,-1,-1
Test-driven development means having the technology and the architecture to test application code in a sandbox and getting the same behavior when it is deployed in production.,N/A,-1,-1
"Test-driven development should provide the ability to step through the code, establish invariants, and utilize other defensive programming techniques.",N/A,-1,-1
Evolving business requirements frequently drive changes in technology.,N/A,-1,-1
"As a result, applications must run on and work with a variety of platforms and products.",N/A,-1,-1
"The goal is to make data, wherever it lives, accessible to the end user via SQL and standard APIs.",N/A,-1,-1
"For example, a state of the art platform should allow data that is in Hadoop and processed through MapReduce to be moved to Spark or Tez and processed there with minimal or no impact to the code.",N/A,-1,-1
Applications should be written in code that is not dependent on an individual virtuoso.,N/A,-1,-1
"Code should be shared, reviewed and commonly owned by multiple developers.",N/A,-1,-1
Such a strategy allows for building teams that can take collective responsibility for applications.,N/A,-1,-1
"If companies follow these eight rules, they will create resilient, scalable applications that allow them to tap into the full power of big data.",N/A,-1,-1
"Supreet Oberoi is vice president of field engineering at Concurrent, Inc.",N/A,-1,-1
"Previously, he served as big data technical evangelist and director of technical delivery at American Express, where he was responsible for conceptualization, design and development of enterprise big data platforms across customer marketing, credit risk, fraud risk, enterprise growth, and other information-based functions within the company on a global basis.",N/A,-1,-1
It should no longer be a secret that apps in the app store offer in-app purchases.,N/A,-1,-1
Some of these in-app purchases unlock content and features that transition an app from a trial version of the app into a fully unlocked version.,N/A,-1,-1
Gamers have even identified what is known as  paywalls  that prevent further progress within a game without the aid of virtual goods purchased via an in-app purchase.,N/A,-1,-1
"The question being asked is are such apps truly  free,  and if not, should they be labeled and marketed as  free  apps 

The word  free  has been scrutinized in advertising long before apps were ever sold in an online app store.",N/A,-1,-1
"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) here in the U.S. has published guidelines for the food industry to follow when referring to claims such as  fat-free,   cholesterol-free,  and  sugar-free.",N/A,-1,-1
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has also published guidelines for how to use the word  free  in advertising and online commerce with promotions like  buy one get one free.,N/A,-1,-1
"It now appears that starting next month, the word  free  may no longer be used when referring to apps that offer in-app purchases.",N/A,-1,-1
"In the past, the European Union (EU) has taken issue with how easy it was for app shoppers to inadvertently run up large bills by making multiple successive in-app purchases, especially when children were making the purchases.",Union,6,6
"With stories of young boys and girls spending $2,500 on Zombies vs Ninja and $1,400 on Smurf Berries, parents were growing tired of being stuck with the bill.",N/A,-1,-1
"As a result, many companies like Apple have refined how such purchases take place.",N/A,-1,-1
This time around the EU is taking aim at labeling apps that include in-app purchases as being  free.,N/A,-1,-1
Earlier in the year the EU started expressing a strong desire to change the way free to download apps are being marketed.,N/A,-1,-1
In a press release the European Commission stated quite plainly that  Games advertised as  free  should not mislead consumers about the true costs involved.,N/A,-1,-1
Google for one has stepped up and starting next month will address how it labels apps that offer in-app purchases.,N/A,-1,-1
This change may begin in EU markets but the way in which such apps are labeled could have a sweeping change all around the world.,N/A,-1,-1
Keep in mind that it is not just the way apps are labeled that is at issue here.,N/A,-1,-1
"When Amazon first opened the Appstore for Android, it did so by kicking off a  Free app of the Day  promotion.",N/A,-1,-1
Among the first free apps to be given away on Amazon s store was Angry Birds Rio.,Rio,16,16

The catch was that you had to download and install Amazon s Appstore app for Android.,N/A,-1,-1

"For the rest of us, there are a few best practices you can utilize when it comes to shopping for apps in the app store:

I m not against paying for apps.",N/A,-1,-1
"With over 2,500 apps in my iTunes app purchase history, I am certainly no stranger when it comes to buying apps.",N/A,-1,-1
"I even give in when the kids ask me to pay for a bag of diamonds, a chest of gold or a pile of gems.",N/A,-1,-1
"However, I do wish it was a little easier to determine just how much an app is going to cost me before I start using it.",N/A,-1,-1
"Last summer, I took the plunge and bought an electric car.",N/A,-1,-1
"After a bit of research, I decided on an all-electric Nissan Leaf.",N/A,-1,-1
"A little over 12 months and close to 10,000 gas-free miles later, I couldn t be happier about my decision.",N/A,-1,-1
"But countless short-distance commutes, weekly cross-city drives and one semi-adventurous road trip have also taught me a lot about the shortcomings of electric mobility.",N/A,-1,-1
"My biggest pet peeve  The hassle of finding, and using, public charging stations.",N/A,-1,-1
"First, a few words about my car of choice.",N/A,-1,-1
"The Nissan Leaf isn t as splashy, or expensive, as a Tesla, but it does a great job as a city commuter car, and is actually surprisingly zippy when you need to speed up to merge onto the freeway or get the head-start at a traffic light turning green.",N/A,-1,-1
"And yes, you can tell by my use of words like zippy that I m not really much of a car person, so I don t miss the roaring engine sounds, but rather enjoy the quiet drive, plus all the other benefits that an electric vehicle has to offer: no painful trips to the pump, no oil changes, free parking in some municipalities, and the privilege to drive with just one person in California s carpool lanes.",California,81,81
"The Leaf s batteries have a nominal range of 85 miles per charge, but depending on your style of driving, use of the A/C and the actual route, 70 miles are more realistic.",N/A,-1,-1
"That s still plenty when you just drive around in the city, and on most days, I just charge it up at home.",N/A,-1,-1
"But when I head to the Silicon Valley to visit with companies, or drive around San Francisco for an extended period of time, I have to charge up.",Valley,7,7
"But when I head to the Silicon Valley to visit with companies, or drive around San Francisco for an extended period of time, I have to charge up.",San Francisco,16,17
"There will be close to 15,000 public charging stations in the U.S. in 2015, according to Nissan.",N/A,-1,-1
"If you live in the Bay Area or any other metropolitan area where plenty of people buy electric cars, chances are there s always one nearby.",Bay,5,5
Finding it can however be a challenge.,N/A,-1,-1
Nissan s own on-board navigation system helps to locate stations and even query them to see whether they re free or in use.,N/A,-1,-1
"However, frequently, the system shows that no one is using a particular station while failing to inform you that the garage is actually closed at the moment.",N/A,-1,-1
"That can be annoying when you re looking for a parking spot that happens to have a charger, and a real nail biter when you re running low on juice and really, really need to charge up soon.",N/A,-1,-1
"Crowdsourced smartphone apps like Plugshare can help take some of the pain out of charging station discovery, but the whole process is still pretty flawed and ripe for improvement.",N/A,-1,-1
Maybe with Android Auto Google is going to add charging stations with real-time availability information to Google Maps  One can always dream.,N/A,-1,-1
But finding a public charging station is only half the battle; using them can be hit or miss as well.,N/A,-1,-1
"I m not talking about fast chargers vs. regular chargers and the time it takes to get your car going again, but the fact that not all charging stations are managed equal.",N/A,-1,-1
"Most stations are run by or in cooperation with large charging networks like ChargePoint, eVgo and Blink, and each and every one of these networks has different conditions.",N/A,-1,-1
"ChargePoint membership is free, but fees can vary widely from charging station to charging station, and you ll have to be a member of their network to charge your car.",N/A,-1,-1
"Each network has different rates, plans and rules, and for each, you ll need to apply for a separate card, provide payment information and register your car.",N/A,-1,-1
"It s like getting a new credit card for each gas station you frequent, and it s a big headache.",N/A,-1,-1
What s needed instead is what I d like to call cross-network roaming.,N/A,-1,-1
"When you use your phone while on the road, it occasionally taps into a competitor s cell tower to keep you connected, and when you get money from an ATM, you don t have to worry whether it s being run by your bank.",N/A,-1,-1
It just works.,N/A,-1,-1
"Yes, it may charge you a bit more, but if run out of money (or juice, in the case of your car), you re happy it works.",N/A,-1,-1
The same kind of interoperability is desperately needed for electric charging stations.,N/A,-1,-1
"Nissan actually took a first step in that direction this summer by introducing yet another card, called EZ Charge, that allows for interoperability across four networks   but the card is currently limited to select markets, as well as 2014 and 2015 Leafs.",N/A,-1,-1
"That leaves out owners of every other electric car, as well as quite a few charging stations.",N/A,-1,-1
"What s really needed are direct deals between the various networks so that car owners only need to register once, and then pay their charging fees through the network of their choice.",N/A,-1,-1
"Because in the end, it s just silly that cars with the next generation of power supply should be harder to fill up than your average gas guzzler.",N/A,-1,-1
"Box Co-founder and CEO Aaron Levie came on the Structure Show this week to talk about his company, the competitive landscape, and some recent trials and tribulations with the public market.",N/A,-1,-1
"Levie is s smart guy and an engaging interview, so read these highlights and then listen to the whole thing to hear his thoughts on everything from the API economy to how APIs might remake the economy.",N/A,-1,-1
"There was a little bit of a market correction that occurred that made it probably less desirable to fully go out and be public,  Levie said, noting that he s still limited in what he can say because the company is still in a pre-IPO quiet period.",N/A,-1,-1
"Still, he added, Box was able to raise $150 million after it delayed the IPO in order to keep on growing.",N/A,-1,-1
"For the last time, Dropbox isn t in the same league   by design

 In reality, there s sort of two markets.",N/A,-1,-1
"There s the file synchronization and sharing part of the market, and we ve obviously invested quite heavily in that part of our business   we re often seen as an enterprise leader in that space   but the big opportunity, I think the big market that we re going after is what used to resemble the traditional content management and enterprise collaboration market,  Levie explained.",N/A,-1,-1
"He s more concerned with replacing the old SharePoints and Documentums of the world with something new, that lets them manage their content in a way designed for the 21st century business lifestyle.",N/A,-1,-1
"It s necessary, he said, because even a would-be dangerous competitor like Microsoft still hasn t integrated SharePoint with its cloud-storage offerings, which means there s an opportunity for a company that has a more integrated service and vision:

 What we saw pretty early on was that the economics in this space were going to be very challenging in the consumer side of the business because at some point in the curve consumers would be able to get free and infinite storage from one the big technology incumbents.",N/A,-1,-1
"But in the enterprise market, the theory was that actually the more devices, the more locations you shared from, the more people that you needed to work with, would actually introduce more and more complexity for the enterprise, and that would actually mean there was a massive opportunity to build very differentiated software to help companies manage their data.",N/A,-1,-1
"Box bought a small machine learning startup called dLoop in December 2013, and began talking about how the technology could help it make more sense of metadata and generally make content-management a more intelligent experience.",N/A,-1,-1
"Here s Levie s take on what s coming down the pike from Box will in this area:

 If you think about this category as hard drives in the cloud, then nothing really gets smarter about our information, nothing gets smarter about our work process.",N/A,-1,-1
"If you start to imagine,  Well, what could you start to do if you knew more about the user, if you you knew more about the data, if you knew more about what the user wanted to do with the data in relationship to the people you share with, or the security policies of their company,  then you actually begin to reimagine in a way that makes business more fluid, in a way that makes people more productive.",N/A,-1,-1
"And I think more of what we ll be talking about at BoxWorks is how you can actually begin to compete in new ways with your information, and how you can actually change and transform a lot of these processes.",N/A,-1,-1
"Is there a hub in the SaaS world, or just a lot of well-connected spokes 

 We used to have this notion of the hub, it was the ERP system or was kind of the main corporate database, or the Active Directory system,  Levie explained.",N/A,-1,-1
"I think that notion is actually evolving, where if you think even about your own personal experiences with technology, less and less there s actually a hub.",N/A,-1,-1
"There s different services that you use for specific problems, that happen to overlap and connect to the other services that you use.",N/A,-1,-1
So there s not any one controlling paradigm or service for all of those experiences.,N/A,-1,-1
I think the enterprise is going to be more and more similar to that model.,N/A,-1,-1
"What that means is businesses might use Box to manage their content, so, ZenDesk for helpdesk support and something else for some other process.",N/A,-1,-1
"Each of those companies will have its own ecosystem of partners, but will also integrate with the others meaning customers no longer need to bet the farm on a single vendor s suite of products.",N/A,-1,-1
"And I think that s just the changing paradigm of enterprise software that many traditional kind od IT leaders, and especially the incumbents in the technology space, are still kind of wrapping their minds around and trying to to figure out how you adapt to that,  Levie said.",N/A,-1,-1
"The Valley is at this really interesting moment in time where if, as a snapshot, you look at what was announced at YCombinator s demo day [recently]   you have nuclear energy, you have new genomic startups, you have new biotech emerging,  Levie said.",Valley,1,1
"I think we are starting to see the viability of these new business models in sort of non-software, or at least not traditionally software-defined markets   [I]t means we have the metaphors, we have the sort of precedent for what will mean to do interesting stuff with robotics, with artificial intelligence, with new bioinformatics.

But this problem illustrates a huge opportunity looming with the internet of things: making data available at the point where it s most useful.,N/A,-1,-1
"This requires access to data, an ability to separate the signal from the noise in that data, and then the ability to deliver it at the time when it s most useful.",N/A,-1,-1
"You might argue that it should be delivered in the format that s most useful, as well (after all, those emails don t help me at the meat counter).",N/A,-1,-1
"Ideally, a consumer never has to know about food recalls if the producers and distributors do their job, but based on the undeclared allergens that I see, a concerned parent of a highly allergic child might welcome an app that provides these recalls along with traditional and expected ingredients of a packaged food product.",N/A,-1,-1
"Imagine a parent with a mobile app that can store a specific allergy or allergies; after scanning food items, the app provides a Yes or No indication.",N/A,-1,-1
"This app could pull in data from the food producer via an API, the FDA database and perhaps eventually from the manufacturing facility via sensors that understand what goes into each individual batch.",N/A,-1,-1
"Think this is nuts  Well, McDonald s has built an app for stores in Australia that does something similar:

There are other apps trying to bring data to the consumer at the point of action, such as Buycott, an app that cross references a database of products and the companies behind those products with information about what causes they support.",McDonald,6,6
People can use it to avoid genetically modified foods or to eat only at restaurants that are run by pro-lifers.,N/A,-1,-1
"IBM is building a massive system to disclose what foods were produced sustainably by tracking everything about the food s growing conditions and then compressing all that data into usable information to be consumed by grocers, farmers or even the average shopper.",N/A,-1,-1
But so far most of these apps draw primarily from databases and APIs.,N/A,-1,-1
What happens when sensor data gets added to the mix as in the IBM example  Parsing that information to make it available and useful will become more expensive and challenging when designing world-class user experiences.,N/A,-1,-1
"For example, in the allergen app use case, why would a food manufacturer open up data about what ingredients are going into its products  That s likely highly confidential information.",N/A,-1,-1
And getting data from the FDA as an API will require someone to manually access and clean the existing FDA data and then host it online.,N/A,-1,-1
"Could we make this part of the government s open data efforts  So in some cases, there s no incentive to share sensor data, and in others the data requires cleaning to be consumed in a useful format.",N/A,-1,-1
"For an allergen app, people might buy something good because their kid s life is at stake, so it could make sense to work through the issues.",N/A,-1,-1
People will pay for the data cleaning efforts and access to APIs with the price of a download if the service provides information that could save their child s life.,N/A,-1,-1
"But what about those other situations 

The home health and wellness tracking market is a good example of consumers getting a lot of data that can seem almost meaningless outside of a few quantified-self buffs.",N/A,-1,-1
So how do you build products that show the average user what they want to see.,N/A,-1,-1
"Basically, a simple way to tell if their sleep, movement, eating and vitals all match up to a healthy lifestyle.",N/A,-1,-1
"And If not, where should they focus 

TicTrac, an app that grabbed my attention earlier this summer when Samsung showed off its platform for tracking fitness information, provides a perfect example.",N/A,-1,-1
"The company s app was built as a consumer web platform for aggregating a ton of social sensor and fitness data, but consumers don t pay for it.",N/A,-1,-1
"Instead, big insurance firms and corporations do, according to Jeremy Jauncey, chief revenue officer and co-founder of TicTrac.",N/A,-1,-1
"The company has found success letting other companies use its technology under their own brand, so you might end up with personalized insights from your employer or maybe an insurance provider.",N/A,-1,-1
"Eventually, your doctor might offer such a service.",N/A,-1,-1
"Businesses pay based on the customizations they ask for (your insurer might want to track preventative health measures like exercise, while your doctor wants to track nutritional information) and on a per-user basis.",N/A,-1,-1
"The key here is that the consumer inputs data from their own devices and web services, but the platform also accepts data from other arenas.",N/A,-1,-1
Your doctor might input your health data if you give her permission.,N/A,-1,-1
"Your employer, if it buys the service, might input stats relevant to your job performance.",N/A,-1,-1
"Combine your professional and personal data, and you might see that your ability to answer emails goes up when you listen to music.",N/A,-1,-1
"Plenty of things get lost in the data points that only come from one device,  Jauncey said.",N/A,-1,-1
But doing that level of integration so far means only big business is buying TicTrac.,N/A,-1,-1
"Eventually it might offer services to consumers, as well.",N/A,-1,-1
"I, for one, would love to pay for a TicTrac backend on an app that tracks data related to migraines.",N/A,-1,-1
I might also get a discount from my doctor if I provided access to that data back to him for research purposes.,N/A,-1,-1
"The next wave is the personal data economy where their data has value, and is an asset they can trade,  said Jauncey.",N/A,-1,-1
"That isn t the case today, when consumers tend to provide their data from free to platforms, sometimes even giving up their ownership rights entirely.",N/A,-1,-1
So we re still a long way off from getting easy-to-understand information at the point of making a decision.,N/A,-1,-1
"And even before we figure out the user interface and algorithms that will create those insights, there s clearly a lot of work to do on the business model to even get the right data into the right place.",N/A,-1,-1
"We ll be discussing these business models in depth at our Structure Connect event Oct. 21 and 22 with various executives representing companies in healthcare, retail and the smart home.",N/A,-1,-1

"Look who is building a streaming dongle now: Microsoft is getting ready to launch its very own Chromecast competitor, according documents filed with the FCC that were unearthed by Windowsphonedaily this week.",N/A,-1,-1
"The FCC application for the device with the model number HD-10 is heavily redacted and doesn t actually spell out what it can be used for, only revealing that it comes with a HDMI port, Wi-Fi and a USB connection for power supply.",N/A,-1,-1
"However, a blogger at Nokiapoweruser was able to add a piece to the puzzle by querying the Wi-Fi Alliance product database, which describes the HD-10 as a Miracast dongle.",Alliance,19,19
This means that the device can be used to mirror a user s mobile or desktop screen to the TV.,N/A,-1,-1
"However, Miracast doesn t come with any of the advanced multi-screen features that are offered by Google s Cast protocol, including the ability to queue up media from multiple participants at the same time, or play multiplayer games.",N/A,-1,-1
"Another key difference is that Miracast is based on streaming media directly, in a P2P-like fashion, from the sender device to the receiver, whereas Google Cast merely points the receiver to a media resource that can be hosted in the cloud.",N/A,-1,-1
"Still, it s interesting that Microsoft would add such a dongle to its device line-up.",N/A,-1,-1
"Building its own streaming dongle could help the company to bring screen mirroring to Windows phones and Windows 8 apps, which have thus far been ignored by others.",N/A,-1,-1
"Google only offers its Cast SDK for Android, iOS and web apps, and Apple only offers AirPlay for iOS and OS X devices.",N/A,-1,-1
"Things have been pretty quiet on the cloud front from Verizon since last October, when the company made some pretty big promises for its brand new, built-from-scratch cloud.",N/A,-1,-1
"But, starting the first week in September, that cloud, which has been in beta for months, will be broadly available to paying customers.",N/A,-1,-1
The game plan has been tweaked a bit in the intervening months.,N/A,-1,-1
We ve enlarged the scope of our next-gen cloud and included a managed service tier   which is one thing our customers have been asking for.,N/A,-1,-1
"And we ve been on-boarding services from a brand-new console,  said Siki Giunta, global SVP for Verizon Enterprise Solutions, in an interview.",Enterprise,19,19
"Giunta joined Verizon 5 months ago (well, 5 months and 23 days ago, but who s counting ) from CSC, where she directed that integrator s global cloud business.",N/A,-1,-1
"We have the base compute, object store, network for very competitive pricing and then we have a rate card for guided services, where we take over more of the traditional management like monitoring and patching but the customer still brings their own templates.",N/A,-1,-1
"And then we have premium where we do all the maintenance of the applications,  she said.",N/A,-1,-1
This tiering of base level from higher-end services is becoming the norm for cloud providers.,N/A,-1,-1
Rackspace and CenturyLink   which also has roots in the telecom universe   are doing similar price breakouts.,N/A,-1,-1
"What is new is that the company will offer Verizon Cloud Compute as described last year, but will also layer service tiers and a new interface atop that base cloud.",N/A,-1,-1
And the promise of Amazon-like capabilities without the noisy-neighbor headaches that can afflict workloads on public clouds remains in place.,N/A,-1,-1
"And, Verizon will offer its new cloud in tiers   Verizon Cloud Compute is the new cloud platform as described last year.",N/A,-1,-1
"But there will also be a  unified  Verizon Cloud offering that layers service tiers and a new interface atop that base cloud, Giunta said.",N/A,-1,-1
"And for the record, Verizon continues to field its legacy Terremark-based Enterprise Cloud; but the plan is to migrate those customers over to the new infrastructure in time.",Enterprise,12,12
Giunta said she came to Verizon because she saw big possibilities in aggregating that company s various telecom and networking assets into a broad offering that can accommodate not just current business workloads but a the growing mass of next-gen applications that fall under the broad Internet of Things rubric.,N/A,-1,-1
"In those applications, machines often talk to machines (hence the M2M jargon) without human intervention and data from all those devices   from Fitbits or Jawbones to jet engine sensors   get aggregated and parsed.",N/A,-1,-1
Verizon is a strong M2M player and we ve aggregated 400 partners in that area.,N/A,-1,-1
"we see a trend that IoT creates the dynamic of a cloud that uses network and wireless network   and we feel strongly that we have a cloud that is IoT ready,  she said.",N/A,-1,-1
"Verizon and its partners are migrating its existing m2m applications to its cloud, she said.",N/A,-1,-1
"Over the past few months, I had heard indirectly from Verizon insiders that there were some growing pains and glitches in the rollout of what is, after all, all a very ambitious architecture.",N/A,-1,-1
"Giunta seemed to acknowledge that a bit, noting that while Verizon s new cloud is running for 500 customers in various stages of beta    everything is great and hunky dory until they have to pay something.",N/A,-1,-1
"When billing starts, the rubber meets the road.",N/A,-1,-1
Gartner VP and Distinguished Analyst Lydia Leong said the gist of this news is that Verizon is now doing managed hosting on a more cloud-like platform than in the past.,N/A,-1,-1
"They ll compete with Amazon on some deals, but I see this as more directly competitive with Rackspace, AT&T and CenturyLink,  she said.",N/A,-1,-1
"It was about a year ago when I realized, perhaps for the first time, just how prevalent deep learning was about to become.",N/A,-1,-1

"It was at the KDD 2013 conference in Chicago, and then-Kaggle president and chief scientist Jeremy Howard was discussing how when teams using deep learning entered the company s predictive-modeling competitions, they were winning at an impressive rate.",Howard,17,17
"If someone can figure out a way to make these techniques mainstream, he said, it could be a game-changer.",N/A,-1,-1
"Howard left Kaggle shortly thereafter and began really looking, he says now, for a way to apply his knowledge of machine learning to a field where he could really make a difference   possibly even change the world (he also said as much in December in reply to a question on Quora about his status).",Howard,0,0
"Simultaneously, deep learning was making its way out of research labs and into the hands of a lot more people.",N/A,-1,-1
"There are companies, open source projects, and no shortage of online tutorials trying to explain how it works and actually provide simplified tools for building these models.",N/A,-1,-1
"Nearly every week, it seems, a new paper is published highlighting some new advance in the field, some around building the models themselves and others around specific applications such as sentiment analysis, language understanding or computer vision.",N/A,-1,-1
"Google, Baidu, Yahoo and Facebook went on a buying spree of deep learning talent.",N/A,-1,-1
And now Howard has found his calling as the founder and CEO of a company called Enlitic.,Howard,2,2
He thinks that training deep learning systems on medical images and other patient records could revolutionize the way doctors diagnose and then treat complicated diseases.,N/A,-1,-1
"And although he s only been actively pursuing this vision for a few months,  it s kind of the culmination of 20 years  of seeking the ideal avenue to apply his knowledge of data analysis.",N/A,-1,-1
"This is exactly the right time and exactly the right place,  Howard said.",Howard,12,12
I ve never seen anything like the results of recent advances in deep learning.,N/A,-1,-1
He compares the shift to that of moving from basing banner ad placement on studies or surveys about the IP address of a user to today s advanced segmentation algorithms that analyze thousands of variables.,N/A,-1,-1
"Right now, a doctor will make a diagnosis based largely on how a patient s story fits into a system the doctor understands.",N/A,-1,-1
"In a data-based approach, however, a doctor could start making diagnoses based more on patterns hidden among all their records.",N/A,-1,-1
"The way that would work with deep learning, Howard explained, might be to take medical image, lab tests, doctors  notes and personal information, and use them all to train a deep neural network.",Howard,9,9
"Done in a supervised manner, where the computer is able to associate a set of records with a known diagnosis and outcome, it should be able to learn the feature most strongly associated with given diseases and then help classify any new cases accordingly.",N/A,-1,-1
"Alternatively, one could also imagine training the system in a semi-supervised or unsupervised manner for the purpose of trying to solve some medical mystery.",N/A,-1,-1
"Medical researchers, or doctors, could feed a bunch of troubling, possibly related cases into a deep learning model and see what it learns about them.",N/A,-1,-1
"An easy example might that a certain feature of a set of tumors, hard for the human eye to see, stands out to the model, or that seemingly distinct words tend to be used in the same way.",N/A,-1,-1
"Whatever the models might discover or predict, Howard isn t suggesting they ll do away with a doctor s judgment.",Howard,8,8
"Rather, artificially intelligent computers could provide strong, unbiased second opinions, or perhaps lead a doctor down a path of investigation she other wouldn t have considered.",N/A,-1,-1
"It wouldn t replace the current way of doing medicine,  he said,  but I could imagine it being just as important.",N/A,-1,-1
"Indeed, a lot of people are betting on data and machine learning becoming important parts of the medical field.",N/A,-1,-1
"There s IBM s health-care-focused efforts with Watson, which Howard calls  a kindred spirit,  although it s focused more on learning what s in text books than in analyzing patient data.",Howard,10,10
There are startups such as Lumiata analyzing medical literature to help nurses take over some diagnostic responsibilities from doctors.,N/A,-1,-1
"And then there are projects similar to what Enlitic wants to do, but often focused on specific conditions   work out of Stanford on breast cancer and out of the University of Washington on cardiovascular disease come to mind.",Washington,32,32
"And then there are projects similar to what Enlitic wants to do, but often focused on specific conditions   work out of Stanford on breast cancer and out of the University of Washington on cardiovascular disease come to mind.",Stanford,22,22
"And then there are projects similar to what Enlitic wants to do, but often focused on specific conditions   work out of Stanford on breast cancer and out of the University of Washington on cardiovascular disease come to mind.",University,30,30
"But Howard is confident that deep learning will be the biggest and best thing to happen to medicine, largely because it allows doctors to bring together so many different types of data across so many different illnesses and because its techniques have proven so effective.",Howard,1,1
"For example, although deep neural networks get smarter the more data they analyze, they re already proving remarkably accurate in diagnosing breast cancer using just a handful of images.",N/A,-1,-1
"Howard said convolutional neural networks (arguably the most popular of deep learning models) are achieving near-human level performance in competitions to detect pre-cancerous cells in breast tissue, sometimes on as few as 80 training images (other models might take thousands).",Howard,0,0
"He said 80 images is a  shockingly little  amount of training data, but not entirely surprising when you consider the quality of medical images.",N/A,-1,-1
"Unlike the random pictures of objects used to train many computer vision systems, medical images don t suffer from shadows, funny angles or lack of focus.",N/A,-1,-1
"They tend to be a lot more expressive and concise,  Howard said.",Howard,11,11
"Considering the dearth of quality data some researchers   especially in the cancer field   cite as being an impediment to major breakthroughs, models that can make accurate predictions based on relatively little, if need be, look even more promising.",N/A,-1,-1
"And although it s early in the game   Enlitic only has five employees, is still wrapping up its first round of venture capital and still has a long R&D path ahead of it   Howard is convinced he s onto something.",Howard,36,36
"Deep learning is  definitely the biggest technology breakthrough I ve seen, ever,  he said.",N/A,-1,-1

It s not unusual for the CEO of a company to crow about its performance.,N/A,-1,-1
"It is sort of striking when, in the process of doing so, that CEO admits to big problems in the past.",N/A,-1,-1
"More typically this sort of thing runs along the lines of  we were fabulous before, but now we are even more fabulous   and faster and cheaper too.",N/A,-1,-1
Also better looking!,N/A,-1,-1
You get the gist.,N/A,-1,-1
So that s why this blog post from Eucalyptus CEO M rten Mickos piqued my interest.,N/A,-1,-1
"To be sure, the post is optimistic    Eucalyptus is doing great; it has big customers; its AWS-compatible private cloud story resonates  etc., etc.",N/A,-1,-1
"But he also admits to some big miscues, albeit they re in the rearview mirror.",N/A,-1,-1
"He wrote:

Many reporters like Mickos because when asked a question he often actually says something interesting, not always politic, and takes the consequences.",Many,3,3
So I followed up to try to gain more details of the claimed turnaround.,N/A,-1,-1
He would not provide revenue numbers   private company and all   nor big reference account names other than the  company-wide F-secure deal  announced earlier in the week.,N/A,-1,-1
Nokia s use of Eucalyptus has also been widely reported.,N/A,-1,-1
"The company also closed a  sizeable deal  with a big, unnamed OpenStack member, he said, adding that there are many big, active opportunities and current customers  are expanding again.",N/A,-1,-1
Eucalyptus has seen some major shifts at the top.,N/A,-1,-1
"In early 2013, Co-Founder Rich Wolski stepped down as CTO to return to teaching at UCSB and top sales guy Said Ziouani also left, moving on to head AnsibleWorks as CEO.",N/A,-1,-1
"But at the time Mickos shrugged off those exits, noting that Wolski remains on the board.",N/A,-1,-1
His story remains that Eucalyptus may be small but it s focused and that focus is starting to pay off.,N/A,-1,-1
"We are not the biggest vendor but we are the most efficient one,  Mickos said via email.",N/A,-1,-1
"That s a sentiment he s expressed before, notably at Structure 2014 when he said:  If you have too much money, you buy VMware.",N/A,-1,-1
"If you have too much time, you buy OpenStack.",N/A,-1,-1
But even then Mickos  stance towards OpenStack had softened   he talked about peaceful coexistence with OpenStack and CloudStack.,N/A,-1,-1
"And in a month or so, he will even keynote at an OpenStack event.",N/A,-1,-1
Maybe this is a realization that there is plenty of cloud work to go around and the need for interoperable clouds overrides any vendor-specific concerns.,N/A,-1,-1
"And while Eucalyptus pledges API-compatibility with Amazon Web Services, he has been open about supporting other public cloud APIs as soon as they hit critical mass   which he defines as 30 percent market share.",N/A,-1,-1
He also admitted in response to a question that Amazon API compatibility didn t buy Eucalyptus much early on.,N/A,-1,-1
"Clearly in the past years, it didn t produce great business for us.",N/A,-1,-1
But now the tune has changed.,N/A,-1,-1
More and more customers come to us *exactly* for the AWS compatibility.,N/A,-1,-1
Finally that bet is starting to pay off.,N/A,-1,-1
(Emphasis is his.,N/A,-1,-1
")

The devil s in the details, so we ll be watching for more evidence of this progress.",N/A,-1,-1
I m still not convinced the world needs a dozen or more flavors of OpenStack    some of which offer some degree of AWS compatibility   plus CloudStack plus Eucalyptus.,N/A,-1,-1
But it s always a good discussion.,N/A,-1,-1
Plus writing about Mickos gives me a chance to use the best Structure screen grab ever:,N/A,-1,-1
Apple hasn t officially announced the iPhone 6 but it s already delayed if such a thing is possible: Sources tell Reuters that screen suppliers are  scrambling  to provide enough displays for Apple to produce its next handset.,N/A,-1,-1
"As a result, the introduction of the iPhone 6 could take place later than expected or be in short supply once the phone is launched.",N/A,-1,-1
A pair of suppliers told Reuters of an issue with the display s backlight in June and July which the organization reported on Friday.,N/A,-1,-1
That challenge has reportedly been overcome due to a design change: Apple is opting to keep its two-layer backlight film instead of the thinner single layer it had planned for.,N/A,-1,-1
"This situation is likely one that Apple faces with each new iPhone, although this year could be more difficult if the company introduces a pair of new iPhone models, not a single edition, which is typical to date.",N/A,-1,-1
Apple is widely expected to release both a 4.7- and a 5.5-inch iPhone 6.,N/A,-1,-1
"I suspect the smaller phone will be more readily available and sooner than the larger one, assuming Apple does introduce a 5.5-inch model next month.",N/A,-1,-1
"Why is so hard to make iPhones, at least during the initial production run of a new model  Apple relies on dozens of hardware partners, some making a single important component for the iPhone.",N/A,-1,-1
"The company has to receive enough stock of every little part and have enough inventory for its production partners to actually build the iPhone: Apple contracts that activity out to China-based companies, such as Pegatron.",China,31,31

"Nervana launched in April with a $600,00 seed round.",N/A,-1,-1
The idea behind the company is that deep learning   the advanced type of machine learning that is presently revolutionizing fields such as computer vision and text analysis   could really benefit from hardware designed specifically for the types of neural networks on which it s based and the amount of data they often need to crunch.,N/A,-1,-1
"Indeed, the computers in play do matter: the application of GPUs to run deep learning algorithms drastically improved their performance and made them a viable option for certain tasks.",N/A,-1,-1
GPUs are now the preferred processor type for many researchers and practitioners in the space.,N/A,-1,-1
"Nervana isn t talking too much about the guts of its system just yet, but it appears to be based on something other than GPUs or new types of processors like IBM s new brain-inspired SyNAPSE.",N/A,-1,-1
"And, in fact, Nervana s architecture includes a software component, as well.",N/A,-1,-1
"Co-founder and CEO Naveen Rao explained it to me like this is in an email:

 We re building a fundamentally different kind of computer.",N/A,-1,-1
Deep learning/neural nets have give us the mathematical framework to break apart an estimation problem into many nodes.,N/A,-1,-1
"In addition, [deep learning] doesn t need very precise computations at each node.",N/A,-1,-1
"So, we can actually exploit these features and build a computer that s much more brain-like (but NOT neuromorphic).",N/A,-1,-1
This will solve real-world problems and allow the scale of DL to go to the next level.,N/A,-1,-1
Our approach to deep learning is also quite novel in that we can co-optimize the hardware and algorithms.,N/A,-1,-1
Think of it as a vertical integration from algorithms to logic gates.,N/A,-1,-1
This is how we can achieve such high performance and do it at much less power.,N/A,-1,-1
"We are also writing a software library to take in high level descriptions of neural nets and target them to various hardware platforms, including our own.",N/A,-1,-1
"It will be very interesting to see how the commercial market for deep learning plays out over the next few years and which approaches work (this is something we ll be discussing at our upcoming artificial intelligence and deep learning meetup, as well).",N/A,-1,-1
"I have spoken with many people who legitimately believe the viability of deep learning models is one of the bigger advances in computing ever, but there are still a lot of questions over how a technique that still requires an expert touch will make its way into the mainstream.",N/A,-1,-1
"While GPUs have been the go-to processor in these early stages, there s new research investigating the feasibility of running deep learning algorithms on FPGAs and on systems spanning from supercomputers to scale-out cloud architectures.",N/A,-1,-1
"Microsoft recently proved the models can run effectively on surprisingly few standard CPUs, and at least one other startup trying to commercialize these deep learning is also focused on CPUs and even standard software platform such as Hadoop.",N/A,-1,-1
"Already, there are cloud-based services popping up that, even if they run on GPUs, remove (possibly thankfully) the choice in processor and much of the model-tuning complexity from the buyer.",N/A,-1,-1
"Nervana is certainly prescient in trying to design deep learning systems early in the game, hopefully establishing a name for itself as the de facto systems vendor in the space.",N/A,-1,-1

Then we went a step further to look specifically at the tech and leadership roles.,N/A,-1,-1
"Where relevant, we also charted the demographic information of the U.S. labor force and the graduating computer science class.",N/A,-1,-1
"Please note that the numbers in the company charts come from a range of sources   federal EEO-1 data, company blog posts, and annual corporate reports.",N/A,-1,-1
"In some cases, particularly diversity in leadership roles, the companies have slight differences in how they collect and categorize their demographic data (For example: counting a global workforce versus just U.S. based).",N/A,-1,-1

But our charts represent the best comparisons we could draw among the companies.,N/A,-1,-1
"When appropriate, we explained the differences in the footnotes.",N/A,-1,-1
"Based on our research, Amazon, Oracle, and IBM appear to be the last big tech company holdouts for releasing staff demographics.",Oracle,7,7
None of them responded to our requests for comment.,N/A,-1,-1
"Unlike their peers at Twitter and Facebook, these holdouts haven t had as much pressure placed on them to release their numbers.",N/A,-1,-1
"It looks like the public is far more interested in the companies that capture the most consumer attention; the unsexy, bigger, older corporations are left alone to their own devices.",N/A,-1,-1
"We spoke with Pinterest engineer Tracy Chou, who some credit as being the first to get the ball rolling on this issue when she published a blog post last October asking  Where are the numbers   She said that although she s excited at the transparency shifts, the true work will come in a year s time.",Tracy,5,5
"It s ironic when you look at how consumer web companies build their products: You always measure everything in your funnel, you try out new strategies for growth and you measure the metrics.",N/A,-1,-1
"But we weren t doing any of that with workplace data,  Chou said.",N/A,-1,-1
"Chou believes there needs to be a  state of the union  every year, where companies release their new staff demographic data.",N/A,-1,-1

HP clocks in as the company with the most white people on staff: 71.5 percent.,N/A,-1,-1
"Apple looks to be the most diverse tech company, but as we ve written about before, that s because it can include its retail store employees in its data.",N/A,-1,-1
"As a baseline for comparison, we also pulled the numbers of the U.S. workforce demographics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).",Bureau,18,18
The U.S. workforce has a much larger swath of white employees than the tech companies.,N/A,-1,-1
"That s potentially because the BLS doesn t consider Hispanic or Latino as an ethnicity (which the tech companies did), and it groups Hispanic and Latino people into other races.",N/A,-1,-1
"Leadership demographic data was a particularly tricky one to decipher, so don t treat the company comparisons as gospel.",N/A,-1,-1

"Apple is by far the most diverse in terms of leadership roles filled with people of different ethnicities, although, once again, without a detailed explanation of who counts as a  leader,  it could have manipulated the definition to make its numbers look good.",N/A,-1,-1
"Tech companies have both technical and non-technical roles, and the people who occupy the former type of job are notoriously male.",N/A,-1,-1
"The stats prove this out, with Twitter s technical staff only 10 percent women, and Facebook and Yahoo s at 15 percent.",N/A,-1,-1
"The other companies fare nearly as badly, with only Pinterest and eBay surpassing the 20 percent mark (at 21 and 24 percent respectively).",N/A,-1,-1
Part of the problem tech companies face in staffing people of diverse ethnicities and gender is that there aren t enough women or minorities coming down the pipeline from computer science programs.,N/A,-1,-1
"As a base line of comparison, consider the American computer science graduate data for gender: Sure enough, only 14.5 percent of the people graduating with bachelor s degrees in CS are women.",N/A,-1,-1

"The carrier wants to work with its peers to create an  industry coalition to launch a new, global online store for mobile applications.",N/A,-1,-1
"Sounds great right  Sure, if you re a carrier, since it s another potential revenue stream.",N/A,-1,-1
But this dead-end road is fraught with problems and it s a path we ve been down before.,N/A,-1,-1
This new store effort would be aimed at Google Android phones   that makes sense since Android is the leading platform when it comes to smartphone sales around the world.,N/A,-1,-1
"Frankly, carriers wouldn t be able to do this with iOS since Apple is intent on controlling the app store experience for its phones and tablets.",N/A,-1,-1
There s no other viable choice for a carrier-backed app store.,N/A,-1,-1
"How exactly would such a store benefit consumers and developers over Google s own Play Store though  Carrier billing is already available through Google s store for many carriers, so that s not a new benefit.",N/A,-1,-1
"Developers would surely have to modify their existing Android apps for yet another store, much as they do for the Amazon AppStore now.",N/A,-1,-1
So that s not an appealing thought either.,N/A,-1,-1
"Note: Amazon s effort works because it has specific devices that are tied directly to its AppStore; carriers could try the same approach, but who s going to switch to carrier-based phones with a new store at this point 

Simply put, there s little tangible benefit to anyone but the carriers if Verizon pushes this movement forward.",N/A,-1,-1
The Information says the carrier is also talking to handset makers for support.,N/A,-1,-1
"Some might get involved but Samsung, the largest seller of Android phones in the world, already has its own Samsung Apps store; and it s not setting the world on fire either.",N/A,-1,-1
"Why would it add a third store option to its phones when it too wants to control the experience 

If all of this sounds familiar, that s because it should.",N/A,-1,-1
Time and again we ve seen groups try to do end-arounds on the existing app stores to get a piece of the profit pie.,N/A,-1,-1
"Back in 2010, for example, two dozen carriers banded together to create the Wholesale Applications Community (WAC); an effort that sounds very similar to what Verizon is reportedly proposing.",N/A,-1,-1
"What, you haven t heard of the WAC  That s because the idea got whacked out of existince, ending in failure just two years after starting up.",N/A,-1,-1
That example happened relatively early in the new mobile app economy that started in 2008.,N/A,-1,-1
"We re halfway through 2014 at this point and the existing app stores are even more entrenched   customers know them, trust them and buy from them.",N/A,-1,-1
It s far too late to crate a carrier-backed mobile app ecosystem at this point.,N/A,-1,-1
And I don t know of a single person who s asking for one.,N/A,-1,-1

"If these sound like wildly ambitious companies to be going through a startup accelerator best known for incubating a cloud file sharing company and an apartment sharing platform, that s because they are.",N/A,-1,-1
You can t help but be a little suspicious when faced with a whirlwind three-minute pitch that claims to be the end of AIDS or the beginning of the commercial nuclear fusion market.,N/A,-1,-1
"At least, I couldn t help but be a little suspicious.",N/A,-1,-1
"The audience members, on the whole, seemed impressed.",N/A,-1,-1
"Bitcoin was another prominent theme, with no less than five bitcoin companies presented, from a bitcoin ATM (they set it up in the lobby for anyone hoping to cash out) to a secure bitcoin identity company.",N/A,-1,-1
"One   a bitcoin ATM card that lets you purchase items anywhere   even managed to silence the perennially sassy The Next Web reporter Roberto Baldwin, who otherwise was simply livetweeting his own drinking game based on the demo day clich s.

As to be expected, startups offering on-demand services continued to be huge this year, with no less than five companies that were the  Ubers of something.",Baldwin,23,23
"There was an on-demand for bouncers, on demand for massages (side note, guys that already exists twicefold), even on demand valet parking (that company s obviously hoping to dissuade the stereotype of the Silicon Valley snobby tech elite).",Valley,40,40

U.S. and German security researchers have proposed a new security framework for Android that would make it easier to install new security extensions   both enterprise and consumer   for specific purposes.,N/A,-1,-1
A major aim is to make Android friendlier to corporate bring-your-own-device schemes.,N/A,-1,-1

"The researchers, from North Carolina State University and Technische Universit t Darmstadt, described the Android Security Modules (ASM) framework in a paper (PDF) that will be presented at the USENIX Security Symposium in San Diego on Friday.",University,7,7
"The framework (source code info here) can already be installed on a rooted Android phone, but the hope is for Google or a big phone manufacturer to bake it into the operating system.",N/A,-1,-1
"Senior author William Enck said in a statement that plenty of researchers are coming up with new security extensions to protect Android users, but  these new tools aren t getting into the hands of users because every new extension requires users to change their device s firmware, or operating system.",N/A,-1,-1
The ASM framework allows users to implement these new extensions without overhauling their firmware.,N/A,-1,-1
"Here s how the framework works: Any time an app wants to execute a sensitive operation that might affect security, it would need to get permission from an ASM module that may have been installed by the user or perhaps by an employer.",N/A,-1,-1
"For example, a company might install a  dual persona  module on its employees  phones, to keep business and personal data separate (think Samsung s Knox system).",Knox,27,27
"In this scenario, when WhatsApp asks for contacts, the module might filter out all contacts marked  business .",N/A,-1,-1
"Or, a user-installed module might always make sure that WhatsApp only gets an empty contacts list   one way of dealing with the big security problems posed by apps demanding to get permanent access to everything if you want them to work at all.",N/A,-1,-1
The idea of filtering contacts or changing permissions per application is not new.,N/A,-1,-1
"There have been proposals for this sort of functionality before,  Enck told me by email.",N/A,-1,-1
What is new in ASM is the ability to develop and install extensible security modules in a generic way.,N/A,-1,-1
We are not just talking about contacts.,N/A,-1,-1
ASM can enhance security protection of every security relevant operation in the Android OS.,N/A,-1,-1
"Indeed, the paper references many existing Android security enhancements that researchers have proposed.",N/A,-1,-1
"Enck himself co-authored two: Kirin, which constrains app permissions, and Aquifer, which provides a policy framework for information workflow between applications.",N/A,-1,-1
Enck said he and his fellow researchers have already shown the ASM framework to Google  as well as several phone manufacturers.,N/A,-1,-1
"The biggest adoption boost would of course be the inclusion of the framework in the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) itself, which would allow ASM modules to be deployed on Google-Android as well as forked-Android devices.",N/A,-1,-1

Time Warner confirmed the deal happened in June and the implementation has been rolling out this month.,Warner,1,1
"The interconnection doesn t come as a huge surprise given that Netflix has signed agreements with Comcast, Verizon and AT&T in the last few months after fighting with the providers directly and through its transit providers Level 3 and Cogent.",N/A,-1,-1
That fighting unfortunately left consumers caught in the middle between Netflix and ISPs as the quality of their video streams suffered and both Netflix and ISPs blamed each other.,N/A,-1,-1
"While Netflix has signed these paid peering agreements with ISPs, it is still arguing before the FCC and in the court of public opinion that these agreements violate the spirit of network neutrality.",N/A,-1,-1
Netflix originally tried to address peering issues by offering ISPs access to its own content delivery network called OpenConnect.,N/A,-1,-1
It signed deals with some U.S.-based and a number of international ISPs that led to Netflix deploying caching boxes inside the ISPs  networks.,N/A,-1,-1

If the iPhone expected to be announced on September 9 has a bigger screen   and that certainly seems likely   one major unanswered question is what the resolution of the bigger screen will be.,N/A,-1,-1
"A new tidbit unearthed in the latest Xcode SDK beta indicates that the new iPhone could have a 828 x 1472 screen, which would add both horizontal and vertical screen space to Apple s iOS interface.",N/A,-1,-1
"The additional pixels open up the possibility of additional rows or columns of icons on the home screen, although there is no indication that Apple is planning to change from the 24-icon home screen layout currently used on the iPhone 5S.",N/A,-1,-1
"The hint was found in an iOS 8 file defining where icons go on the iPhone home screen, Mark Gurman at 9to5Mac reports.",N/A,-1,-1
"The file itself describes an iPhone home screen with an effective resolution of 414 x 736, which results in a 828 x 1472 resolution when doubled per Apple s current method of handling Retina displays.",N/A,-1,-1
"Previous reports have indicated that Apple is toying around with a  pixel-tripling  mode, which indicates that 1242 x 2208 is a possible resolution as well.",N/A,-1,-1
"The new resolution would not only add vertical pixels, the way Apple did with the iPhone 5, but would add horizontal screen space as well.",N/A,-1,-1
"The screen would retain a 16:9 aspect ratio, which matches up with the parts leaks we ve seen so far.",N/A,-1,-1
"However, the additional pixels added to the effective resolution could end up being a headache for developers because it would require additional work to update apps for the newest iPhone.",N/A,-1,-1
Back-of-the-envelope calculations and previous reports have pointed to other candidates for the new iPhone resolution.,N/A,-1,-1
"Currently, developers work with a 320 x 568 default screen size for the iPhone 5S, which results in a 1704 x 960 resolution when tripled.",N/A,-1,-1

There is one handy smell test for possible iOS screen resolutions: Do they end up exceeding the arbitrary Retina display cutoff of 300 pixels per inch  Turns out a 828 x 1472 resolution would qualify as a Retina display at both 4.7 and 5.5-inch screen sizes.,N/A,-1,-1

"Here s a screenshot that shows what violators  agree  to pay, including $0.10 per server request and $1 for each item of personal information collected:

Craigslist did not reply to a request to explain the penalties, or to which violations they apply, but they are likely related to the terms of use section that prohibit  Robots, spiders, scripts, scrapers, crawlers, etc.",N/A,-1,-1

"So far, Craigslist s legal strategy has proved controversial, as Craigslist briefly claimed copyright of users  classified ads, and it is also accusing PadMapper of violating federal hacking laws.",N/A,-1,-1
"But since there has yet to be a final ruling in the PadMapper case, Craigslist appears to be using the click-through tactic as a way to strengthen its legal hand.",N/A,-1,-1

"Still, it s far from clear if the Craigslist penalties will hold up in court.",N/A,-1,-1
"One reason is that such click-through contracts typically act as a shield for the company, rather than a sword for the company to collect money.",N/A,-1,-1
It s also unclear if a court would accept Craigslist s view that  actual damages are hard to calculate  and that the $0.10 service figure is reasonable.,N/A,-1,-1

Database vendor MongoDB is adding what it calls  production support  to the popular community edition of its NoSQL data store.,N/A,-1,-1
"The company announced the new option in a blog post on Monday, citing strong demand by community edition users for the same level of support enterprise edition customers receive.",N/A,-1,-1
"Previously, as is the case with many other NoSQL databases, support for community edition versions was limited to forums and other similar channels, while paid support was only available with the souped-up enterprise edition.",N/A,-1,-1
The news wouldn t be too interesting in and of itself   there are plenty of open-source-based companies offering paid support for software that s free to download and use   but it might speak to some changing dynamics in the NoSQL space.,N/A,-1,-1
"Notably, competitors such as Couchbase haven t gone away but continue to raise venture capital and win new customers, and database vendors of all stripes are beginning to support the JSON file type around which MongoDB has built its technology.",N/A,-1,-1
Offering paid support for the community edition is a way for MongoDB to double down on its open source message.,N/A,-1,-1
"Look,  it can claim,  we offer quality, free open source software and you can use it in production with confidence.",N/A,-1,-1
It s also a way to boost the company s bottom line.,N/A,-1,-1
"MongoDB has lots of users, but rumors persist that it s not signing up as many as it would like for the enterprise edition, meaning it has lots of non-paying users.",N/A,-1,-1
"But even if they haven t paid for it in dollars, they probably have paid for MongoDB in time and energy.",N/A,-1,-1
"If even a fraction of those users decide to secure that investment with production support, MongoDB could see a big spike in the revenue column.",N/A,-1,-1
"The company has been talking about going public for quite a while, and earlier this month it brought on a new CEO with IPO experience.",N/A,-1,-1
"Previous CEO Max Schireson claims to have relinquished the role for personal reasons (and laudable ones, at that), but it s difficult to separate the change in leadership entirely from the revenue demands that public investors will put on MongoDB when it decides to make that plunge.",Max,2,2

"ADT, the home security giant, plans to link its Pulse home automation and security system with If This Then That in the coming months, as it seeks to protect its business from the influx of connected DIY security products flooding the marketplace.",N/A,-1,-1
"To do this, ADT has released products that are more mobile-friendly, such as the Pulse app, and has expanded the definition of security for the digital era.",N/A,-1,-1
"We protect a place   a premise   but that doesn t provide security in the twent-first century,  said Arthur Ordu a, ADT chief innovation officer, in an interview.",Arthur,18,18
"Besides protecting a place, let s protect a person and allow them to retain that level of control when they walk out the door We do a fabulous job of protecting the physical asset of you, but the rest of you is your bits and bytes stored around the world, so we re thinking of your digital life.",N/A,-1,-1
"With all of that in mind, ADT has been working on products such as a digital security partnership with McAfee that was unveiled at CES and the ADT Canopy app, a service that lets you share the locations and whereabouts of loved ones on the go.",McAfee,20,20
"Pulse, which lets ADT subscribers get home automation gear and services for a fee, was launched four years ago and has seen a number of improvements, such as the recent launch of voice control.",N/A,-1,-1
But the link with IFTTT would open up Pulse to a much broader ecosystem of products.,N/A,-1,-1
"Ordu a says ADT loved services like Life 360, which lets you track your family members  locations, and wanted to work with the startup without interfering with its business as a formal partner.",N/A,-1,-1
"It could do that through the IFTTT channel, since Life 360 is an IFTTT channel partner.",N/A,-1,-1
"Some proposed IFTTT recipes suggested by ADT include:

Ordu a expects that in the next year we ll see new recipes and a public unveiling of an ADT IFTTT channel, but first the company wants to test recipes and implementations with beta customers for ease of use and also security.",N/A,-1,-1
"Much like others providing high-value services, ADT is laser-focused on elements such as access to passwords and reliability for its customers, which can mean that simply linking up APIs isn t an option.",N/A,-1,-1
"But as it adds new services, ADT will start with free options so that its 7 million paying customers get more value.",N/A,-1,-1
"Of those, only 850,000 are Pulse subscribers, so the idea is to expand that number as well.",N/A,-1,-1
"However, Ordu a isn t afraid to take on challengers in the market who are trying to offer security without subscription fees.",N/A,-1,-1
He doesn t discount the possibility of new offerings that might appeal to the DIY crowd as a way to broaden ADT s customer base.,N/A,-1,-1
"For now, we ll wait and see what ADT does.",N/A,-1,-1
"It s certainly offering an intriguing option for its Pulse subscribers with an eventual IFTTT integration, but I ll want to wait and see it in action before I get too excited.",N/A,-1,-1

"BuzzFeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith has responded to criticism of the media company s mass deletion of thousands of old posts, a move that Gawker and others have slammed as an ethical breach of the highest order: in an interview with the Poynter Institute s  Regret The Error  columnist Craig Silverman, the BuzzFeed editor admitted that the way the articles were deleted was not handled well, but he said both the deletion and the criticism of it are a part of the site s evolution.",Institute,44,44
"Smith echoed the defense that BuzzFeed founder Jonah Peretti has provided since Gawker first detected early signs of the mass deletion, saying most of the articles were created when the site was seen as  an experimental lab  for media, rather than a journalistic organization.",N/A,-1,-1
"Many of the pieces that got deleted, he said, were jokes that no longer worked, or posts with Flash games embedded in them, or posts that no longer displayed properly because of all the changes to the site s content-management system over the years.",Many,0,0
While some have suggested that BuzzFeed deleted posts because they contained plagiarized material or were poorly sourced   something the site has been criticized for a number of times   Smith said that this was not the main problem with a majority of the posts that were removed.,N/A,-1,-1
"And he agreed that the process could have been handled differently, and the site could have communicated the reasoning behind it more effectively:

For me, one of the most interesting aspects of the deletion was the fact that the articles to be removed weren t selected by Smith or Peretti or other BuzzFeed editors, as I think many critics of the move assumed they were   judging by the number of comments that implied some kind of centrally-directed conspiracy to cover up plagiarism, etc.",N/A,-1,-1
"Instead, Smith told Poynter that half a dozen writers were given the choice of which posts they had written before 2012 they wanted to delete, and which they wanted to fix or update.",N/A,-1,-1
"Go through your stuff and save what you care about,  Smith says he told his staff.",N/A,-1,-1
"Writers had the option to repair broken links or fix display problems, or update the posts by filling in the various content fields required by the company s new content-management system, Smith said   adding that in hindsight, the deleted articles should have had a note attached to them or some kind of explanation, so readers wouldn t be surprised by their disappearance.",N/A,-1,-1
"The BuzzFeed editor also said that the process of deletion, and the fact that it was left up to the writers to decide which posts to remove, were an attempt to retain some of the experimental spirit that BuzzFeed had in its early days.",N/A,-1,-1
As the site continues to grow   thanks to an ambitious global expansion plan and $50 million worth of financing from a group of venture investors   Smith said he felt that it was important to keep some of the entrepreneurial aspects of the company alive.,N/A,-1,-1
"More than anything, the deletion reinforces the fact that a big part of BuzzFeed s struggle as it tries to evolve is the need to somehow marry that experimental nature with its more serious journalistic ambitions.",N/A,-1,-1
"As Smith put it, BuzzFeed is  a media company that includes a news organization, but that is not solely that.",N/A,-1,-1
"Standards around plagiarism and sourcing and other ethical concerns have to be addressed   and as Poynter notes, editor Shani Hilton is putting together a standards guide for the organization   but there are parts of BuzzFeed that will likely always adhere to somewhat different standards, because they aren t meant to be journalism.",Hilton,20,20
"The site is trying to communicate those differences better by taking a number of steps, including separating its content into sections like News (for serious journalism), Buzz (for experiments) and Life (for lifestyle topics), but Smith suggests it will continue to be a process of experimentation.",N/A,-1,-1
"Unfortunately for BuzzFeed, experimentation and the mis-steps and failures that inevitably come with it aren t something most traditional media outlets or journalists are that familiar with, so the criticism of the site is likely to continue.",N/A,-1,-1

"Services such as Apple s Activation Lock have already shown how greater security measures reduce crime, and in the U.S. lawmakers recently got handset manufacturers to promise to include a kill switch.",N/A,-1,-1
"The Met s National Mobile Phone Crime Unit (NMPCU) told me by email that it favored the passcode being switched on at the point of sale,  preferably set by the user to enhance security.",Mobile,4,4
"That s good, because a generic number like 1111 would create the risk of people not bothering to change it, and thieves being able to easily guess it.",N/A,-1,-1

Greene has kept a low profile in the six years since being ousted as VMware CEO by that company s EMC overlords.,Greene,0,0
But here are a few more tidbits gathered from various sources around the Valley.,Valley,13,13
"One: It is true, as Gigaom reported a year ago, that Greene is involved in Datrium, a stealthy company purportedly involved in storage virtualization.",Greene,14,14
"But it appears she is an investor, not a hands-on executive.",N/A,-1,-1
Two: Greene is spending more of her time on Demeterr an even shadowier startup with a name that is likely to change.,Greene,2,2
"Demeterr, as its sparse web site noted, has offices in Los Altos and San Francisco and is looking to add more Javascript software engineers, application developers, mobile software engineers and UX designers to its current staff of 18.",Los Altos,12,13

Yup.,N/A,-1,-1
"Pretty vague, I know.",N/A,-1,-1

"Despite being the bestseller on Amazon s own cellphone site for awhile, the phone doesn t account for much web browser traffic, according to a new report from online advertising network Chitika.",N/A,-1,-1
Chitika says web usage on the Fire Phone has only risen to 0.02 percent in the first 20 days after the handset launch.,N/A,-1,-1
"By comparison, the LG G3   a similarly priced high-end handset that has earned favorable reviews   had triple the web traffic on Chitika s network in its first 20 days.",N/A,-1,-1
"In addition to a better display and faster processor the G3 wasn t limited to a single carrier, which surely helped the handset s uptake.",N/A,-1,-1
"Illustrating the point of exclusives potentially hurting sales growth, Chitika s report also shows web usage data for the Motorola Droid Ultra, which launched in 2013 as a Verizon exclusive.",N/A,-1,-1
That phone saw the same 0.02 percent of web traffic over its first 20 days as the Fire Phone.,N/A,-1,-1
It s worth noting that the $199 Motorola Droid Ultra was actually one of three new Motorola Droid phones launched simultaneously: The $99 Droid Mini and $299 Droid Maxx shared shelf space and sales were likely split between the trio.,N/A,-1,-1
"Exclusive phone launches can work, of course.",N/A,-1,-1
"Apple s iPhone was limited to AT&T in the U.S. for several years, but that s an extreme example.",N/A,-1,-1
The iPhone helped revolutionize the current smartphone era and it took competitors a long time to make comparable devices on other platforms.,N/A,-1,-1
The Amazon Fire Phone is no Apple iPhone in this regard.,N/A,-1,-1
"Yes, it has some unique features but uniqueness doesn t necessarily equate to a  must-have  feeling.",N/A,-1,-1
The phone interface and performance still has room for improvement; even Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has said the company must be patient with its first smartphone effort.,N/A,-1,-1
"To that end, Amazon released its first software update for the Fire Phone earlier this week.",N/A,-1,-1
"That s a start, for sure, but it might have helped if Amazon had debuted the phone on multiple carriers instead of just one.",N/A,-1,-1

"We must not fall for this,  said Reicharts in her speech.",N/A,-1,-1

"The controversy over the ruling, issued by the European Court of Justice, has arisen in part because the court provided little guidance about how it is to be applied, including part of the ruling that says the right-to-be-forgotten doesn t always apply if the public interest is at stake.",Justice,12,12
"In July, Google s head lawyer wrote an article in the Guardian about the difficulties of balancing privacy rights and the public interest.",N/A,-1,-1

"With the introduction of the Hue tap wall switch a few weeks ago, I have now been able to replace the lights in my living room that came with my house using Philips  connected Hue gear.",N/A,-1,-1
"All told, the Hue bulbs ran me $200 for a starter kit containing 3 bulbs and a hub.",N/A,-1,-1
I paid $60 for an additional bulb and another $60 for the Hue tap switch to control the lights.,N/A,-1,-1
"So the question any sane person would ask: Was switching from my incandescent can lights and traditional wall switch in the living room worth it 

If you want colored LED bulbs that can tie into a variety of smart home services to do everything from blink a certain color when someone calls you or sync to an established lighting track to make your viewing of Sharknado a bit more immersive, then yes, it s worth it.",N/A,-1,-1
"If you are a bit less fancy and want a connected lighting system that will turn on and off in response to preset patterns or formulas, then there are cheaper options that will perform as well.",N/A,-1,-1
"But as the services that add value to the smart home expand, I think most rooms should probably have at least one light bulb that can change color and every light bulb should be connected.",N/A,-1,-1
"But let s get to the Hue tap from Philips, which is the catalyst for this review.",N/A,-1,-1
I have had Hue lights installed in my living room since about October 2013 and found them fun for playing with from a color-changing standpoint.,N/A,-1,-1
I loved having so many scenes to work with but I hated having to open an app to turn them on or off.,N/A,-1,-1
"So nine times out of 10 they behaved like normal lights that I turned on and off from the switch, meaning that 90 percent of the time my connected lights were  broken.",N/A,-1,-1
"When I wanted to turn them on from my phone, I d first have to get up and walk to the switch to turn it on.",N/A,-1,-1
I even joked with friends that I needed a smart light switch so I could turn the lights on using the app too.,N/A,-1,-1
"So in March, when Philips said it was going to make the tap   a self-charging wall plate that offered four different buttons for the Hue   I was stoked.",N/A,-1,-1
The hockey-puck-sized device is fun to click (you can hear it on this podcast where I discuss the experience with Kevin Tofel) and has four buttons you can set.,N/A,-1,-1
"You do have to press pretty hard to click the buttons in, which is annoying when it is taped to the wall, but fine when it is used more like a remote.",N/A,-1,-1
"Adding the tap to your system is a matter of a few clicks; opening the app, selecting add a device and then pressing the tap.",N/A,-1,-1
The fun is in setting up the buttons.,N/A,-1,-1
"The default for the big button is off and at first I had it turning off all of my Hue lights, which mean the bulb on my bedside table also turned off.",N/A,-1,-1
This could be useful if you want a master switch that turns off all the lights in the house or an Away version that controls a light or two in each room.,N/A,-1,-1
You could pop that by your door and hit the switch when you leave.,N/A,-1,-1
"And because the tap is powered by every click you make, there s no wiring or battery to worry about.",N/A,-1,-1
Since Philips just released a $30 white-light connected LED (no colors) we are getting closer to a more economical way to connect each bulb.,N/A,-1,-1
"Plus, note that when Philips announced the white LED it has initially said it would cost $40, so clearly prices are coming down for these bulbs.",N/A,-1,-1
"However, if you aren t into using color yet, and don t care to turn individual bulbs on and off, you could instead spend $50 on a Belkin WeMo wall switch.",N/A,-1,-1
You can install it yourself or pay $150 or so for an electrician to come out and install the connected switches.,N/A,-1,-1
"Then you get on/off capabilities and scheduling, as well as being able to tie all the lights on that switch to an event such as a door opening or motion sensor.",N/A,-1,-1
"There are other connected light bulbs out there, but as I learned, having a connected switch is really important.",N/A,-1,-1
Another option is replacing your switch with a Lutron switch that lets you dim existing bulbs and also ties to a remote.,N/A,-1,-1
"Some hubs such as the Wink, the Staples Connect Hub and Lutron s own hub all support that radio.",Staples,8,8
I use a Lutron wall plate and remote that cost $65.,N/A,-1,-1
"As a bonus, if you use the Staples Connect hub, you can control your Hue lights with the Lutron remote, which is smaller and sleeker than the tap.",Staples,8,8
So my take away is a connected switch is probably more useful and cheaper in the near term than connected light bulbs.,N/A,-1,-1
"But if you want to spend big, buying a connected switch and connected bulbs is the way to go for individual control and some cool services as you get more advanced in the connected home.",N/A,-1,-1
"For me, $320 is a lot of money, and I won t put the setup in every room in the house, but I think I will move my colorful Hue light bulb into my daughter s room and buy a tap for it (we ve used different colors to indicate different messages and it s a nice alarm clock).",N/A,-1,-1
I also think I ll put a tap and two white Hue bulbs in our bedside tables for controlling the lights at night and setting an alarm.,N/A,-1,-1
That means I ll be spending about $200 more.,N/A,-1,-1

"Part of the reason why Twitter is more news-focused than Facebook has to do with the underlying mechanics of both sites, and the way user behavior has evolved as a result.",N/A,-1,-1

"And while Twitter has added embedded images and other Facebook-style features over the past year or so, Facebook is still filled with a lot more content that makes it difficult to process a lot of information quickly.",N/A,-1,-1
"Then there s the nature of the community: although Facebook has tried to embrace Twitter-style following, which allows users to see updates from others even if they aren t friends, in most cases people still use the platform the way it was originally designed   in other words, with a symmetrical follow model that requires two people to agree that they are friends before they can see each others  updates.",N/A,-1,-1

"And then there s the other aspect of the Facebook environment that makes it more problematic as a news source: namely, the fact that Facebook s newsfeed is filtered by the site s powerful ranking algorithms.",N/A,-1,-1

"Why do I bring up these tiresome labels  Because I was reminded of them in stark terms when reading a weekend piece by TechCrunch s Danny Crichton, in which he argued that algorithms are becoming  the champions of workers.",N/A,-1,-1
"I strongly disagree, and will continue to do so until I see algorithms that take the workers  side in disputes with their employers.",N/A,-1,-1
"If anything, the on-demand economy is symptomatic of a world where workers have less control over their environment and destiny, not more.",N/A,-1,-1
"Crichton s argument goes like this: The on-demand economy, embodied by services like Uber and TaskRabbit, puts workers  fundamentally in control of their economic lives  because they can choose their working hours and therefore  develop their own personalities and brands.",N/A,-1,-1
"Algorithms could  provide a vastly improved market for work  more convenient, safe and lucrative,  thus finally obsoleting not only labor unions, but also employment laws.",N/A,-1,-1
"Per Crichton s piece, the improvements come mainly in terms of flexibility, which used to be  the exclusive preserve of elite talent    not only does this have benefits of convenience, but health too, because  control over one s work  reduces stress and  can literally extend a worker s life expectancy.",N/A,-1,-1
"Unions, meanwhile, were previously useful for establishing a model of full-time employment with benefits such as leave and pensions.",N/A,-1,-1

I can t help but feel that Crichton has somewhat missed the point of unions.,N/A,-1,-1
"Yes, creating a better workplace is a big part of that purpose, but so   fundamentally   is the ability of workers to organize themselves so they can speak with a collective voice.",N/A,-1,-1

It s about maintaining healthy power dynamics.,N/A,-1,-1

"Sure, if individual workers don t like the work then they can theoretically leave, but they can and will be replaced immediately.",N/A,-1,-1
That s the whole point of the on-demand economy   it s taking full advantage of the fact that the supply of workers greatly outstrips demand.,N/A,-1,-1

Who asked for that  The unions.,N/A,-1,-1

I get that Crichton isn t calling for permanent instability in employment.,N/A,-1,-1
"As he wrote,  the market has to be built in such a way that stability is a possible outcome for those who seek it.",N/A,-1,-1

The idea that a handful of platforms operating on razor-thin margins will create an equitable world for their workers   that algorithms written by the employers will protect workers  rights better than the workers themselves and their elected representatives could   would be funny if the reality of this model weren t so outright terrifying.,N/A,-1,-1
"Ultimately, if work is to truly benefit the worker, she needs to have a voice and real clout.",N/A,-1,-1

"Instead,  parents need to be involved   No matter what kind of media your child is using   book, audiobook, iPad   make sure you have plenty of co-play time with your child.",N/A,-1,-1

"I ve watched her mindlessly flip through an app, getting the same error messages over and over   as if the error messages themselves were a game.",N/A,-1,-1
"The recommendation, again, is that parents insert themselves and make sure they are part of the app experience, rather than setting their child digitally free.",N/A,-1,-1
There are times when Born Reading makes the act of reading to a child seem like   well   like a lot of tedious work.,Reading,5,5

"Yet all of those solutions introduce additional concerns, management overhead, and costs.",N/A,-1,-1
"Innovation in storage technology doesn t end with bigger drives and cloud solutions; other technologies are poised to solve the complexities of data storage and its rapid growth, with software-defined storage (SDS) showing the most promise.",N/A,-1,-1
SDS solutions could radically change the enterprise storage market.,N/A,-1,-1
Significant research by leading vendors has indicated that the software-defined storage market is expected to be worth at least $5 billion by 2018.,N/A,-1,-1
"The tangible benefits offered by SDS, which are realized almost immediately, are fueling this growth.",N/A,-1,-1
"As with other software-defined solutions, SDS enables network operators to better manage the storage, flow, and access to the incredible amounts of data generated by rich media, big data, business analytics, and wireless device adoption.",N/A,-1,-1
"SDS brings those benefits to bear by leveraging virtualization technology that abstracts data from the storage hardware, creating a virtual representation of the physical storage that eases the reconfiguration of resources and allows the pooling of dissimilar storage systems into a cohesive centrally managed representation of all storage resources available, regardless of the underlying hardware technology, physical location, and storage platforms in use.",N/A,-1,-1
"With SDS, organizations are able to call on available resources and re-provision subsystems on the fly, creating a paradigm-shifting experience around storage ideologies.",N/A,-1,-1
"That has created excitement in the storage industry, driven some of the biggest tech names in the industry to buy startups focused on SDS, and led private equity and venture capital investors to funnel dollars to new players in this nascent arena.",N/A,-1,-1

"If you were having a heart attack and dialed 911 on your mobile phone, which would you prefer: Responders arriving in your neighborhood are stuck trying to determine which household needs help, or responders are pounding on your door because they know your exact address 

Such questions need to be asked in light of the FCC taking a look a how to handle wireless 911.",N/A,-1,-1
"Specifically, the FCC is contemplating a 50-meter accuracy goal, an approach that does not pinpoint an address.",N/A,-1,-1
"An alternate solution that provides far better accuracy   and more importantly, a real address instead of approximate coordinates   uses Bluetooth and Wi-Fi beacons.",N/A,-1,-1
"While a landline phone is linked to a physical address, wireless 911 today is based on X/Y coordinates calculated by various methods.",N/A,-1,-1

"Public-safety organizations as well as consumers, many of whom have cut the wireline cord, are pressuring the FCC for improvements in location accuracy in case a caller can t provide an address.",N/A,-1,-1
"High-density beacon technology, while seeing rapid adoption in consumer applications, has not previously been considered for determining precise location in emergency situations simply because it had not yet matured.",N/A,-1,-1
"However, it could be the basis for a far more accurate way to direct responders than anything possible in the past.",N/A,-1,-1
"Nervous cord cutters could finally feel safer, but only if regulators, consumers, and industry stakeholders give beacon technology the serious consideration it deserves.",N/A,-1,-1
The use of Bluetooth-based beacons in consumer applications is growing quickly.,N/A,-1,-1
"Apple employs the technology in its iBeacon indoor proximity system, for example.",N/A,-1,-1
"To work, beacons, each costing as little as $5, must be deployed throughout an area at fixed locations.",N/A,-1,-1
"Phones receive signals from beacons and, based on signal strength, can approximate the distance from a given beacon and report that location to the network or an end application.",N/A,-1,-1
The maximum range is 50 meters.,N/A,-1,-1
"Consequently, where deployed, iBeacon can accurately track customer locations.",N/A,-1,-1
"Stores are the typical adopters of this technology, but beacons are also finding their way into museums, where they can provide users additional information based on their step-by-step location, down to the specific exhibit, as National Geographic did recently in its Washington, D.C., museum.",Washington,45,45
Deploying beacons would present vast opportunities for users to interact more richly with their environments and for venues to learn about people and their movements.,N/A,-1,-1
"Apple has a long, successful history of introducing new technology when market conditions are receptive, so iBeacon is one sign that beacon technology has arrived.",N/A,-1,-1
Now is the time to evaluate the role beacons could play for wireless 911.,N/A,-1,-1
"The benefits are overwhelming, and no alternative can deliver a dispatchable address.",N/A,-1,-1

"The FCC s notice of proposed rulemaking issued last February contemplates mandating an accuracy requirement of 50 meters in the horizontal plane and 3 meters in the vertical plane, to be implemented two to three years from now.",N/A,-1,-1
"This accuracy goal, if it could be realized, might be an improvement over existing accuracy requirements, but no technology exists today that can achieve it.",N/A,-1,-1
"Multiple candidate technologies, including ones from NextNav, Polaris Wireless, and Qualcomm, were evaluated last year by the Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council (CSRIC), the agency tasked by the FCC to analyze potential approaches.",Council,27,27
"As reported in the CSRIC  Indoor Location Test Bed Report,  none of the three location technologies met the 50-meter goal for any of the four location types, comprising dense urban, urban, suburban, and rural settings.",N/A,-1,-1
"Moreover, the FCC s proposed accuracy goal fails to meet the most fundamental objective of public safety: enabling emergency responders to quickly reach the caller s exact location.",N/A,-1,-1
"First, the 50-meter radius translates to a diameter the length of a football field, hardly pinpointing an apartment or home   10 buildings could fall into that radius.",N/A,-1,-1
"Second, even if the coordinates were accurate, the translation of these coordinates into street addresses (via reverse geocoding) tends to render moot the accuracy of the initial position fix.",N/A,-1,-1
"Improving the accuracy of reverse geocoding will be a complex, long-term endeavor that will be akin to starting over.",N/A,-1,-1
"In contrast, beacons are configured to know the address and can quickly provide it to a phone, even if the user has Bluetooth turned off.",N/A,-1,-1
"When a user makes a call to 911, the dispatcher can still send help to the correct location because the beacon provides the phone the location, which is then supplied to the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP).",Point,37,37
Two main challenges must be overcome for beacons to become a reality.,N/A,-1,-1
The first is awareness.,N/A,-1,-1
"Consumers and our industry must get smarter on the capabilities of beacon technologies, their low-cost, and their ease of implementation.",N/A,-1,-1
"The second is making beacons ubiquitous, since none are yet available for wireless 911.",N/A,-1,-1
"However, no other technical approach has been deployed to any extent either.",N/A,-1,-1
No reason exists to believe that a beacon approach will take any longer to deploy than other options.,N/A,-1,-1
"In fact, the widespread integration of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi in handsets means a beacon system could even be faster to deploy.",N/A,-1,-1
"Given today s reality of having to implement any new solution from the ground up, why not do it the right way, using a dispatchable-address approach 

Multiple organizations, including local governments, agencies setting building codes, hotel associations, commercial real-estate enterprises, and others will need to become involved to encourage the spread of beacons.",N/A,-1,-1
Widespread participation is both critical and appropriate public safety is everyone s responsibility.,N/A,-1,-1
"Fortunately the opportunities to deploy beacons are endless: They can be placed as low-cost standalone devices, within routers or set-top boxes, in overhead lighting, in emergency-exit signs, and so forth.",N/A,-1,-1
"The beacon is simply a low-cost, low-power chip.",N/A,-1,-1
New-building codes could require their installation.,N/A,-1,-1
"Before they become prevalent in indoor locations, users could buy them with their new phones or could be encouraged to buy one from any electronics supplier.",N/A,-1,-1
"Some simple configuration would be required for entering the address, which could be done from a smartphone.",N/A,-1,-1
A huge advantage of the beacon approach is that they are independent of any particular mobile network.,N/A,-1,-1
The high-precision location information available from the beacon can be supplied by the phone to any mobile operator s network.,N/A,-1,-1
It can be supplied if the user is on a Wi-Fi connection.,N/A,-1,-1
"It can even work with any phone in the beacon s range, meaning if you re having a heart attack, your visiting friend can call 911 and their phone could work with your beacon.",N/A,-1,-1
"Independently of what happens with beacon technology, two nearer-term developments will improve wireless 911 accuracy.",N/A,-1,-1
"First, devices will soon be able to receive signals from Russian GLONASS satellites, shortening satellite fix time and improving indoor location accuracy.",N/A,-1,-1
"Second, a system called Observed Time Difference of Arrival (OTDOA) will also improve location accuracy.",N/A,-1,-1
"OTDOA, already part of the LTE roadmap and about to become available at the same time as Voice over LTE (VoLTE), is handset based and uses measurements of signals from multiple surrounding base stations.",N/A,-1,-1
"Long term, a beacon-based approach that harnesses Bluetooth and Wi-Fi for accurate, address-based location seems to be the best possible approach.",N/A,-1,-1
But creative thinking will be required to make beacons a reality since they require an infrastructure separate from the cellular network.,N/A,-1,-1
"With so much at stake, including our lives, we owe it to ourselves to do everything possible to make this superior wireless 911 approach a reality.",N/A,-1,-1

"A large percentage of Android users are still not running the latest version of the Android OS, 4.4 KitKat.",N/A,-1,-1
"And Google is making no bones about that, as it regularly posts the latest OS usage figures on its developer portal.",N/A,-1,-1
"Here are the most recent numbers:

At first glance, it looks like a mess.",N/A,-1,-1
"After all, iOS users are predominantly using Apple s latest OS (iOS 7), to the tune of over 90 percent of active installs.",N/A,-1,-1
But that s not the statistic developers should be looking at.,N/A,-1,-1
It s time to talk Google Play Services.,N/A,-1,-1
Play Services is more important than OS installs when planning and designing an Android app.,N/A,-1,-1
"Play Services, introduced in 2012, is effectively a background download of core services required to run apps on Android.",N/A,-1,-1
"Putting the OS install numbers to one side for a moment, this is the stat that matters to developers   over 93 percent of all Android users are running the latest version of Google Play Services.",N/A,-1,-1
"More importantly, Google has been slowly moving core Android features, APIs and app elements out of the OS and into Google Play Services   meaning developers can ensure their apps run smoothly (with all the new features they plan to implement) across all devices carrying the latest infrastructure.",N/A,-1,-1
"Crucially, version 5.0 of Google Play Services is now being rolled out to all Android devices running OS 2.3 Gingerbread up to 4.4 KitKat.",N/A,-1,-1
This sinks the argument that developers are handcuffed to older OS features to ensure legacy compliance of core elements of their app.,N/A,-1,-1
"But what about the screen size conundrum, bringing with it the need for expanded testing and for designers, a dizzying variance of layout requirements

"Designing for Android is  not that hard,  Ivanovic writes,  and honestly causes us less headaches than most people imagine.",N/A,-1,-1
"Many people imagine that the number of potential layouts for Android looks like the frightening graphic below, requiring a specific layout for every screen size variation:

First: never put much stock in vendor-sponsored research.,N/A,-1,-1
"Would Vendor A really publicize the release of benchmarks that show its product is less feature rich/more expensive/slower than Vendor B s  Um, no.",N/A,-1,-1
"As a former IDC research analyst once cautioned more than a decade ago,  you can slice and dice numbers to say anything you want.",N/A,-1,-1
And he who pays wins.,N/A,-1,-1
Always.,N/A,-1,-1
"Second: Cost is not always the primary consideration in technology buying choices, but it s nearly always one factor.",N/A,-1,-1
"Business buyers considering cloud, for example, will want to think whatever they buy is at least in the ballpark of the price leader   and then may opt for a more expensive option.",N/A,-1,-1
Say one with better support and service (which is what Rackspace is betting on).,N/A,-1,-1
Or perhaps something better suited for enterprise workloads which do not have the same requirements as Netflix or another Amazon poster-child account for webscale computing.,N/A,-1,-1
"That is where I would expect VMware, which owns most of server virtualization loads inside company data centers, to put its bets.",N/A,-1,-1

"No, the leaked picture has no relationship to the new USB spec published earlier this month describing reversible USB Type-C connectors.",N/A,-1,-1
But the idea s not totally out of left field: Apple filed a (rather detailed) patent application for a  Reversible USB Connector  in 2013 that describes an invention that looks strikingly similar to the leaked photo from Dickson.,Dickson,40,40
The Dickson leak also backs up photos from a Chinese blog that shows Lightning cables with the same newfangled USB Type-A connector.,Dickson,1,1

So far the results of the project, known as Kindle Worlds, appear lackluster at best.",N/A,-1,-1
"Take the popular series Pretty Little Liars, which became available as an Amazon-licensed fan fiction title last year.",N/A,-1,-1
"In the month of June, authors contributed 46 Pretty Little Liars works to Kindle Worlds, which sounds like a fair number   unless you compare it to the more than 6,000 such works that appeared during this time on two other fan fiction sites.",N/A,-1,-1
"More broadly, on one of those sites, FanFiction.net, fans posted 100 new stories every hour across all categories.",N/A,-1,-1
"And Amazon  Its entire output for all 24  Worlds  of content, which also includes franchises like Gossip Girl and Vampire Diaries, was just 538 stories over the course of more than a year.",N/A,-1,-1
"These figures are cited by law professor Rebecca Tushnet in a new paper that explores why licensed fan content, which seems like such a promising opportunity in the eyes of copyright owners, turns out to be such a bust in practice.",N/A,-1,-1
"According to Tushnet, a big part of the problem is the creative limits that brand owners impose on the use of their work.",N/A,-1,-1
In the case of G.I.,N/A,-1,-1
"Joe, for instance, the villain can t wear a Yankees cap.",N/A,-1,-1
Characters in other works can t use drugs or employ profane language.,N/A,-1,-1
"And gay, bisexual or deviant sexual behavior might be off-limits too.",N/A,-1,-1
"Amazon also bars writers under 18, who are some of the most prolific creators of fan fiction, from contributing to Kindle Worlds (likely because the law makes it difficult to enforce a contract against a minor.",N/A,-1,-1
")

Add it all up, and the fields of imagination and community in Kindle Worlds feel barren next to the rollicking, ribald world of the purely fan universes.",N/A,-1,-1
"The sanctioned space, it turns out, is just not as much fun as the unofficial ones.",N/A,-1,-1
"One fan fiction enthusiast cited by the paper likens Kindle Worlds to a playground of  five quiet, clean, polite children carefully playing together while helicopter parents hovered overhead   Whatever Amazon has created there is no life in it.",N/A,-1,-1
"For Amazon and its partners, it will be difficult to overcome such perceptions since the underlying problem is not just about licensing terms, but something more fundamental: the impossibility of having it both ways, of fostering maximum creativity while wielding maximum legal control.",N/A,-1,-1
"As Tushnet notes, Kindle Worlds is hardly the first time that a licensed model of creativity has come up short: the music industry s imposition of sampling licenses smothered hip-hop in the 1990 s, while commercial controls eroded the popularity of the early fan fiction universe, Darkover.",N/A,-1,-1
"Finally, for both fans and authors, the Kindle  Worlds  may be less enticing because of their borders.",N/A,-1,-1
"Stories created in these worlds can go can only go as far as a Kindle account while, in the unlicensed fan realms, stories travel across the whole internet.",N/A,-1,-1
"In this respect, the dynamics of literary communities share much in common with software, where open platforms are routinely more successful than closed ones.",N/A,-1,-1
All this doesn t mean that Amazon was wrong to launch a fan-fiction environment in the first place.,N/A,-1,-1
"The Worlds are providing a new revenue stream for established authors and their fans, though likely not a big one.",N/A,-1,-1
"For its part, Amazon appears eager to press ahead with the experiment.",N/A,-1,-1
"Early response from licensors, writers and readers has been very positive,  Jeff Belle, Vice President of Amazon Publishing, said by email.",Belle,14,14

"But while Hawkinson is aware that most people will have to wait for the company s actions before accepting that Samsung could be a beneficial acquirer, he is adamant that SmartThings is still committed to the same vision of an open, inclusive smart home platform that it has had since day one.",N/A,-1,-1
"The proof is going to be in the pudding,  he said.",N/A,-1,-1
The vision is still the same.,N/A,-1,-1
To be completely easy for the consumer and open and be the most open over time.,N/A,-1,-1
And they have my personal guarantee and that this is absolutely the mission and vision going forward.,N/A,-1,-1
"He explained that while the discussion between Samsung and SmartThings originally began in May as a partnership agreement after SmartThings opened up its developer program, it progressed quickly to acquisition talks, where SmartThings really  dug in  on the issue of openness, Hawkinson said.",N/A,-1,-1
He said the sale also had nothing to do with the marked increase in competitive offerings from major retailers and even from Apple and Google.,N/A,-1,-1
"It wasn t in my mind to sell at all,  Hawkinson said.",N/A,-1,-1

That means the sale was about scale.,N/A,-1,-1
I agree with Hawkinson that the deal is good for SmartThings provided it keeps its independence.,N/A,-1,-1
I ve always been a big believer in Hawkinson s vision for building out support for all connected objects and giving developers the tools to write apps that bring any types of objects together.,N/A,-1,-1
"As the number of devices proliferates, I m not sure that the approach can scale as opposed to the implementation of a more universal standard, but at least Samsung gives SmartThings the resources to try to keep up with the tsunami of devices to support.",N/A,-1,-1
"There s a huge market here but most of the industry seems to believe the opportunity is based on the platform-centric, app store model that dominates the mobile phone ecosystem.",N/A,-1,-1
"If that s the case then SmartThings would find itself trying to win over both developers and customers while competing against much larger providers, with the idea that more customers attracts developers and more awesome applications would attract more customers.",N/A,-1,-1

"I ve long said that is unrealistic, especially in the home where people buy a variety of devices at different times and brand is just one of many considerations.",N/A,-1,-1
Hawkinson agrees.,N/A,-1,-1
Clearly the closed model doesn t work.,N/A,-1,-1
"If Tony [Fadell, the CEO of Nest] couldn t keep it closed no one can,  he joked.",Tony,1,1
"And if SmartThings  open DNA can influence Samsung, while also getting access to expertise from Samsung s mobile, appliance, television and other businesses, that will only lead to a better customer experience.",N/A,-1,-1

"Clearly, we re a long way off from seeing how this acquisition affects SmartThings.",N/A,-1,-1
Hawkinson promises an updated product road map before the end of the year.,N/A,-1,-1
Maybe he ll share something big when he speaks at our Structure Connect event in October.,N/A,-1,-1
"But until then, he s preaching openness in interviews and in a steady stream of responses to commenters on his company s site.",N/A,-1,-1
He s also assuring developers and customers that the free services they currently enjoy will remain free and will perhaps expand thanks to Samsung s support.,N/A,-1,-1
"Since SmartThings has been very clear that it hopes to make money buy creating an app store of sorts and sharing in that revenue, an assurance of the freemium model is good to hear for both customers and developers.",N/A,-1,-1
"Finally, he didn t get into products we might expect, but he has been hinting at better location and brought that up again in our call.",N/A,-1,-1
"Clearly there is a lot of opportunity creating richer and easier to use experiences and that starts with mobile devices,  he said.",N/A,-1,-1
"Samsung ships one in three smartphones so while we will support all clients, the chance to go deep and nail things like location without draining the battery is really exciting.",N/A,-1,-1

"It is adding dozens of reporters, and clearly has ambitions to become a major media player.",N/A,-1,-1

"Here s what Peretti said:

What s interesting about Peretti s response is that it doesn t sound like the kind of argument you would get from a traditional media entity, or even a new-media site run by journalists   and that makes sense, because Peretti isn t a journalist.",N/A,-1,-1

The problem is that BuzzFeed clearly wants to be seen as a journalistic enterprise now, and in journalism you just don t do that.",N/A,-1,-1

To me, it seems pretty obvious that BuzzFeed wants to be held to new journalistic standards, and as a result is engaging in a kind of online reputation clean-up project   the kind where you remove the embarrassing photos of you wandering around naked at Burning Man, or some other behavior that seemed like a good idea at the time, but now stands in the way of you getting that job you applied for.",Emily,50,50

"Every mobile phone owner has a phone number, and even if every device doesn t support more advanced VoLTE features, any communications session can always default to a phone call or SMS exchange.",N/A,-1,-1

"But is that true  And if so, what should we do about it 

Zuckerman says his thoughts around advertising and its effects were shaped in part by a presentation that developer Maciej Ceglowski gave at a conference in Germany earlier this year.",N/A,-1,-1
"Ceglowski is the founder of Pinboard, a site that allows users to bookmark and store webpages, and someone who has argued in the past that free, ad-supported services are bad for users, since they usually wind up having to sell the company to someone who will ultimately shut it down.",N/A,-1,-1
"Ceglowski describes the arrival of Google as a turning point, since the company   which started out as a kind of science project with no business model whatsoever   eventually created what became AdSense, and showed that advertising could be a huge revenue generator for a web business:

By  investor storytime,  what Ceglowski means is the fairy tale that most web and social companies tell their venture-capital investors and other shareholders   about how much money they will be able to generate once they add advertising to their site or service or app, or aggregate enough user data to make it worth selling that information to someone.",N/A,-1,-1
"Ceglowski calls this process  the motor destroying our online privacy,  the reason why you see facial detection at store shelves and checkout counters, and  garbage cans in London are talking to your cellphone.",London,29,29
"Zuckerman notes that he played a rather critical role in making this future a reality, something he says he regrets, by coding the first  pop-up  ad while he was working at Tripod, an early online portal/community web-hosting company, in the late 1990s (a solution he says was offered to an advertiser because they were concerned about having their advertisement appear on a page that also referred to anal sex).",N/A,-1,-1
"And as advertising has become more ubiquitous, companies have had to come up with more inventive ways of selling ads   and that means using big data:

In his post, Zuckerman admits that free or ad-supported content and services have many benefits as well, including the fact that they make the web more widely available   especially to those who couldn t afford to pay if everything had paywalls   and that being based on advertising probably helped the web spread much more quickly.",N/A,-1,-1
"But he also says that advertising online inevitably means surveillance, since the only important thing is tracking who has actually looked at or clicked on an ad, and knowing as much as possible about them.",N/A,-1,-1
"So what should we do to solve this problem  Zuckerman s proposed solution is to implement micro-payments, using Bitcoin or some other method   something that wasn t possible when the web first arrived.",N/A,-1,-1
"In that way, he says, users will be able to support the things they wish, and won t have to worry about paying with their personal information instead of cash.",N/A,-1,-1
"He asks:  What would it cost to subscribe to an ad-free Facebook and receive a verifiable promise that your content and metadata wasn t being resold, and would be deleted within a fixed window  

In a response to Zuckerman s post, Jeff Jarvis argues that instead of throwing our hands up and declaring that advertising as a model doesn t work any more, we should be re-thinking how advertising works and trying to improve it.",N/A,-1,-1
"Although he doesn t mention it, this seems to be part of what interested VC firm Andreessen Horowitz about BuzzFeed, and caused it to give the company $50 million, valuing the company at close to $1 billion.",N/A,-1,-1
AH partner Chris Dixon has talked about the benefits of BuzzFeed s version of  native advertising  or sponsored content   content that is so appealing and/or useful that it ceases to be advertising.,Dixon,3,3
"For my part, I think Zuckerman has a point to a certain extent: an ad-based model does encourage companies to try and find out as much about their users as possible, and that often causes them to cross various ethical boundaries.",N/A,-1,-1
But this isn t something the internet invented   newspapers and magazines and political campaigns have been doing that kind of data collection for decades.,N/A,-1,-1
The web just makes it orders of magnitude easier.,N/A,-1,-1
"In other words, it probably would have happened even if advertising wasn t the foundation for everything.",N/A,-1,-1
"One of the big flaws in Zuckerman s proposal is that it would still make large parts of the web unavailable to people without the means to pay, either in Bitcoin or something else.",N/A,-1,-1
"And like Jarvis, I think advertising could become something better   if native advertising is useful or interesting enough, and it meets the needs of its users, then it should work much better than search keywords or pop-ups.",N/A,-1,-1
"That s not to say we shouldn t force companies like Facebook to be more transparent about their data collection   we should do that as well, not just let them off the hook by allowing them to charge us directly.",N/A,-1,-1

"ClusterHQ, a big data startup that wants to make a name for itself atop the ever-popular Docker ecosystem, released an open source data manager called Flocker on Wednesday.",N/A,-1,-1
It s designed to deal with the headache created when moving and updating large datasets hosted in Docker across different cloud services or their own internal data centers.,N/A,-1,-1
"While Docker s container management system has been helpful for developers who want to load up their application source code in containers so they can be deployed to bare-metal machines or to various cloud service providers, Docker s not quite ready for prime time when it comes to doing the same for big databases like MongoDB, according to Michael Ferranti, ClusterHQ s vice president of marketing.",N/A,-1,-1
"Containerizing datasets is important for developers who want to build out more complex data-intensive applications that rely on relational databases or NoSQL; if one could link together a containerized dataset to a containerized application, the two could speak to each other while also being able to be moved around and deployed together to various Linux environments.",N/A,-1,-1
"As of now, the problem with housing data sets in Docker containers is that it s a huge chore to have to do operational upkeep on the containerized databases.",N/A,-1,-1
"For example, if a new version of MongoDB comes out and you want to upgrade your older version that s now trapped inside multiple containers, it s a big hassle to have to do so because as of now, there hasn t been a tool available on Docker to ease the burden.",N/A,-1,-1
"At the heart of Flocker is the Sun Microsystems-designed Zettabyte file system (ZFS), which made it much easier for engineers to replicate data and create backups, said ClusterHQ co-founder and vice president of engineering Rob Haswell.",N/A,-1,-1
"With the ZFS, Flocker can monitor a containerized database and keep track of when changes occur; once a change like a database update happens, the ZFS can automatically reproduce the change across other containers that house datasets.",N/A,-1,-1
"Currently, ClusterHQ s data management system can t be tied together with some of the new container orchestration services such as Fig or Panamix, which help spin up multiple containers containing application source code.",N/A,-1,-1
"This limits its utility because while Flocker can ensure that containerized databases are being updated, these databases can t be hooked up to work in tandem with the spun-up application containers in an automatic fashion for heavy duty workloads.",N/A,-1,-1
The UK-based startup hopes to eventually integrate with these services and plans are in the works to launch a commercial support model around the open source Flocker tool; something Docker is working on for its own open source platform.,N/A,-1,-1

"Apple s trademarked iBeacon protocol was developed for iOS devices, but it actually works equally well with Android devices running the appropriate software.",N/A,-1,-1
"In fact, according to a new study by marketing firm Aislelabs, Android phones may prove to be superior devices for searching and connecting to iBeacons, at least as far as battery life is concerned.",N/A,-1,-1
"A few months ago, marketing firm Aislelabs published a study examining the effects of iBeacons on battery drain with Android handsets.",N/A,-1,-1
This new report examines the differences between iBeacon-driven battery drain on iOS and Android.,N/A,-1,-1
"Any device with Bluetooth Low Energy support can theoretically connect to a beacon using a variety of protocols, such as the open-source Altbeacon, but most beacons currently conform to Apple s proprietary iBeacon specification, which was described in developer tools that were released with iOS 7.",Energy,5,5
Android developers were able to adapt Apple s protocol to develop apps and libraries for other platforms.,N/A,-1,-1
"The Aislelabs study found that iOS devices are less affected than Android devices by the number of iBeacons nearby, but iOS devices scanning for iBeacons end up consuming more battery life than similar Android devices, due to Apple s choice of Bluetooth hardware.",N/A,-1,-1
"However, iOS devices are great at handling  ambient beacons,  or iBeacons whose UUIDs don t fall into the defined range set   for instance, an MLB-operated iBeacon would be considered an ambient beacon for an iPhone without the MLB In The Ballpark app installed.",N/A,-1,-1
"Because signals outside the range set are discarded before they are processed, there are minimal increases in battery drain when adding more ambient beacons.",N/A,-1,-1
"Of the six devices that Aislelabs tested, the inexpensive Moto G displayed the best battery behavior, and all three Android devices displayed lower amounts of battery drain when scanning for small numbers of iBeacons than the iPhones.",N/A,-1,-1
"Keep in mind that these figures are based on battery percentage, and the Android devices in the study have larger batteries than the iPhones.",N/A,-1,-1
"As a whole, the tested Android devices are better at scanning for iBeacons without killing battery life.",N/A,-1,-1
"The Moto G, in particular, uses a process called  beacon sampling  to reduce the number of BLE signals it processes   if it were to receive 100 iBeacon advertisements, it would only decode a fraction.",N/A,-1,-1
"No information is lost, as there is a lot of duplication because iBeacons advertise frequently.",N/A,-1,-1
"Apple s range set implementation instead allows developers to filter signals by UUID, allowing ambient iBeacon signals to be discarded, but all iBeacon advertisements that reach an iPhone appear to be decoded to see if the UUID falls into the allowed range.",N/A,-1,-1
"Although Apple defined their own iBeacon specification on top of open-source (and originally Nokia-developed) BLE technology, that doesn t mean it necessarily has an advantage optimizing its devices for BLE signals, even if those signals conform to Apple s own protocol.",N/A,-1,-1

"And for SmartThings, the money and clout that Samsung has will help it support more devices faster   a needed element for getting consumers to buy its hub and attracting more developers to the platform.",N/A,-1,-1
It also means that the platform that SmartThings is building will survive what I expect will be a gradual evolution away from a dedicated hub that threatens those companies solely focused on building these universal remotes for the connected home.,N/A,-1,-1

Or they can wait for it to launch in actual stores in the coming weeks and months to see the devices and hubs for themselves.,N/A,-1,-1

"However, the company does plan to support devices that use Wi-Fi and cloud-based functionality in time.",N/A,-1,-1
Those devices could include products like the Philips Hue lights or the Chamberlain MyQ garage door opener for example.,Chamberlain,12,12
"Schremp defended the hub s paucity of radios saying that the goal was to make home automation simple for consumers, and having a variety of radios like Zigbee andZ-wave added complexity.",N/A,-1,-1

"I m not a fan of the service fee, especially given the number of hubs available on the market that don t require a fee, but the marketing video shows some complicated conditional rule setting that would let you take a picture, turn on the lights and send a text alert when someone comes in the door, so maybe if the software is amazing people will buy it and keep paying monthly for it.",N/A,-1,-1
"And according to a Peter Gerstberger, Director/DMM, new business development at Staples, the chain is excited about the results from in-store tests.",Staples,13,13
He mentioned in an interview earlier this summer that one of the advantages of selling the Connect products is that they have higher margins than the typical tablets and phones that comprise the other in-store electronics.,N/A,-1,-1
He also said the average Connect platform user plays with the app or hits the Staples web site at least eight times a day and on average connects six to seven devices within the first two months.,Staples,15,15
"If Best Buy can make a dent in that market and enough people buy it, that could provide a real boost.",N/A,-1,-1

"In a blog post about the power of social and citizen media, former hedge-fund analyst Conor Sen gave a fairly plausible description of what might have happened in Ferguson before Twitter: namely, anchors and celebrity reporters from the major cable networks would have shown up long after the news was out, and would have gotten a fairly restricted view of what was happening, since their access to the area and to witnesses would be made as difficult as possible:

As sociologist and social-media expert Zeynep Tufekci has written about social-media powered protests and other activity in Turkey, the fact that Twitter allows such information to circulate   and theoretically makes it easier for those outside of a given conflict to know that the authorities are misbehaving, and to collaborate on a response   doesn t necessarily mean that anything substantive will happen as a result (she has also noted the impact of algorithms on determining what we see and don t see through social platforms like Facebook).",Ferguson,29,29
"But regardless of the probability of some larger impact, getting a live perspective on such events is certainly better than not having that information in the first place   or not getting it until much later   and at the moment Twitter (and social media-powered tools like Grasswire and Storfyul) are about the best equipment we have for making that happen.",N/A,-1,-1
Crowdsourced Wi-Fi internet service provider Fon plans to add a business component to its largely residential hotspot footprint.,N/A,-1,-1
"On Thursday, Fon launched a global beta program, inviting consumer-facing businesses to install a souped-up version of its Fonera router and offer internet access to Fon members and the general public.",N/A,-1,-1
"The business network will work a bit differently than the residential one, which is essentially a closed system.",N/A,-1,-1
"Fon residential members, called Foneros, install the Fonera router, which then becomes a node in a hotspot network spanning 13 million nodes worldwide.",N/A,-1,-1
"Any other Fonera has unrestricted free access to the network, as do customers who buy access passes.",N/A,-1,-1
"These new business routers, however, will also be open to the general public for limited use depending on the discretion of the business owner.",N/A,-1,-1
"For instance, a dentist office could chose to give an hour of free internet to anyone in its waiting room, but after that restrict access to all but office staff, Foneros and paid customers, said Itziar Parra, head of Fon s business Wi-Fi group.",N/A,-1,-1
"Any user accessing a Fon business hotspot for the first time would register for a free account, which could then be used to automatically login to any other Fon business hotspot in the future, Parra said.",N/A,-1,-1
The new program seems to split the difference between the two models of business Wi-Fi we see today: wide-open networks businesses offer as an amenity to attract customers and closed networks for internal use.,N/A,-1,-1
"Like the business hotspots being cultivated by Google and Facebook, Fon s would bring businesses into a larger Wi-Fi network, while still putting some restrictions in place.",N/A,-1,-1
FON CEO and founder Martin Varsavsky will talk about these evolving notions of business and consumer Wi-Fi at Gigaom s Structure Connect conference on October 21.,Martin,4,4
The question is whether businesses will want to participate.,N/A,-1,-1
"After all, Wi-Fi is something they can easily offer to customers without the help of any company.",N/A,-1,-1
"To join the beta, companies will have to buy a Fonera router for $69 or  49, but as beta users they will be exempt from future membership fees when the program launches commercially, Parr said.",N/A,-1,-1
What will those future monthly participation charges will be  Parra couldn t say.,N/A,-1,-1
"They will largely be decided by Fon s carrier partners like BT and SoftBank, who offer the Fon service in their home countries, she said.",N/A,-1,-1
"That said, businesses who join will get the benefit of a managed service.",N/A,-1,-1
"After customers register once, they ll be able to easily login to any other Fon Business hotspot.",N/A,-1,-1
"Fon s management tools will let businesses easily set rules for how people access its network, and because every user is registered, Fon will supply basic demographic info to business members on who is accessing their network and analytics on how they re using it, Parra said.",N/A,-1,-1
"In the future, Fon plans to offer more refined tools, Parra said, for instance the ability to offer higher tiers of service to your most loyal customers.",N/A,-1,-1
"Businesses in the 28 countries, including the U.S. and much of Europe, can register for the beta and order a new Business Fonera on Fon s website.",N/A,-1,-1

The Pi is the brains of the device: It s the computer that plays back MP3 files of audiobooks.,N/A,-1,-1
It also connects to the web to let Willem know when his grandfather has listened to all of the pre-loaded books.,N/A,-1,-1
"In that case, Willem simply uploads additional books to the player.",N/A,-1,-1
"Individual book files are tied to DVD cases, each of which has a unique RFID card inside that corresponds to a different book title.",N/A,-1,-1
"By placing different DVDs on the player, different books are read; the Raspberry Pi has an RFID reader to determine which tag is in proximity.",N/A,-1,-1
"How well does it work  Pretty good according to Willem:

"The Wireless Power Consortium recently turned out a new version of its Qi standard, and while the main improvement was its support for resonant charging   that is, sending energy over short distances   it also brought larger appliances into the Qi fold.",N/A,-1,-1

"Namely, the WPC is talking about the blenders, food processors, mixers and coffee grinders that sit on our countertops.",N/A,-1,-1

That s what the company is all about.",N/A,-1,-1
I think the next great financial institution is going to be fundamentally about the dynamic relation with a bank.,N/A,-1,-1
"Today s banking services have an entirely static relationship with their customers, both on a merchant side and a consumer side, and data is what allows for that relationship to become dynamic.",N/A,-1,-1

A classic example instead of being so abstract: The FICO score is pretty coarse.,N/A,-1,-1
"It looks at very few variables and it says  Here, between 700-750 you re pretty great.",N/A,-1,-1
"But 600-650, you re damaged goods.",N/A,-1,-1
"It s actually really predictive, and you d be a fool not look at a FICO score if you are a financial services product because it is in fact extremely effective.",N/A,-1,-1
"The problem with the FICO score, for example, is that you gain jobs and you lose jobs.",N/A,-1,-1
"And in economic crises, it correlates really well with people s ability or non-ability to repay their debts.",N/A,-1,-1
But personal economic crises are not represented in FICO at all.,N/A,-1,-1
"FICO says,  Oh look, you missed a bill.",N/A,-1,-1
"Bummer, lower FICO for you.",N/A,-1,-1
"But the reality is, if your bank had a dynamic relationship with you, it would say you lost your job, so here are two ways to go about this: we can wait for the FICO to update and we can up your rates so the risk can be offset by price and oh, crap for you, you re going to have to go to a 29.99 (percent) APR.",N/A,-1,-1
"Or they can say, wait a second, given where you are and where you re trending and the fact that you lost your source of income, it would be a lot easier if we offered you a service or changed the terms so that we actually lowered the burden so that you wouldn t be constantly stressed out and facing immediate financial ruin.",N/A,-1,-1
"You could paint a terrible story and say they re too big to fail, these guys are just out to get the little guys, but it s not necessarily true.",N/A,-1,-1
They re just too coarse and slow.,N/A,-1,-1

So people were trying to do stuff like this before and they inevitably run into an  oh crap moment  that prevented them from moving forward.",N/A,-1,-1
"Bill Me Later, which we think as a spiritual predecessor for Affirm, was a good product and service, but during the 2008 financial crisis, they got themselves into enough trouble that they had to sell to eBay.",N/A,-1,-1
In some ways I feel like we re carrying the torch forward.,N/A,-1,-1
"Every 10-15 years, somebody says there has to be a better way than FICO.",N/A,-1,-1
"Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn t. At this point I m hypothesizing, but one easy truism is Silicon Valley does live on a four-year cycle.",Valley,21,21
"If your company is a financial service startup and you go through a financial crisis and you survive and your customers still like you, that s when you know you re for real.",N/A,-1,-1
"PayPal did that, a couple times at this point, Bill Me Later did not.",N/A,-1,-1
"So why are you betting on Affirm to weather those storm that have taken out the competition 

I think we re in a better position to do that because we built the business around its dynamism.",N/A,-1,-1

Countries like China and Iran have been trying to control the flow of online information for years.,China,2,2
"Now, there s an app that wants to take a page from the playbook of crowdsourced computing projects like SETI and poke holes in China s so-called great firewall and other censorship efforts.",China,25,25
"Lantern, as the project is called, is offering users in countries with internet censorship a proxy that unblocks social networks, news sites and political blogs.",N/A,-1,-1
"People in China and elsewhere have been using commercial proxies for years, resulting in a game of whack-a-mole, where censors would simply block access to the IP address of a proxy, forcing users to move on to the next available service.",China,2,2
"Lantern wants to solve this issue through a P2P architecture: Users in censored countries don t connect to a central server with an easily recognizable IP address, but instead route their website requests through a computer run by a volunteer in the U.S. or elsewhere.",N/A,-1,-1
"Lantern is a simple app available for Windows, OS X and Linux.",N/A,-1,-1
"Upon running it for the first time, users indicate whether they want to give access or get access to censored sites.",N/A,-1,-1
"And once it runs, the main UI is actually a data visualization that shows usage of the app around the world in real-time.",N/A,-1,-1
"Lantern started out with a network of trust, which means that a user in a censored country could only connect to the proxy of a user he knew, or someone who is a friend of a friend or belonged to an extended circle of friends.",N/A,-1,-1
"More recently, Lantern has also begun to offer cloud-hosted servers help people without trusted relays, and the project is now moving towards an architecture where anyone willing to give access is added to a pool of users that will help users in censored countries to get access to blocked sites.",N/A,-1,-1
"Lantern was also invite-only until just a few weeks ago, but is now starting to open up and promote the idea of a collaborative network of peers that defeat censorship together.",N/A,-1,-1
"I recently met Adam Fisk, founder and president of Brave New Software, the non-profit behind Lantern, in Los Angeles.",Los Angeles,20,21
"Fisk told me that one of the inspirations for Lantern was SETI@home, the popular distributed computing project that uses spare processing capacity on computers of volunteers around the world to find intelligent life in space   except that with Lantern, you re not looking for Aliens, but helping to defeat internet censorship.",N/A,-1,-1
"The other inspiration for Lantern was LimeWire, the file-sharing application that Fisk worked on after college.",N/A,-1,-1
"At LimeWire, Fisk helped building one of the most popular P2P clients of its time, which at some point had 80 million active users, generating five billion search requests every month.",N/A,-1,-1
One of the lessons that Fisk took away from LimeWire was that each user of a distributed network only needs to contribute a small amount of resources to have a huge impact around the world.,N/A,-1,-1
"Lantern isn t the only project looking to circumvent censorship, and getting access to sites like Facebook and Twitter isn t the only issue citizens have in regimes that censor the internet.",N/A,-1,-1
"Surveillance is also a huge problem, and Lantern is not a tool to achieve anonymity.",N/A,-1,-1
"Any connection that is routed through a Lantern proxy is encrypted, but the software can t protect against sites tracking their users, or even more complex internet surveillance schemes, like the ones that were revealed through the Edward Snowden leaks.",N/A,-1,-1
"But Lantern also doesn t bill itself as an anti-surveillance tool, and it s not targeting dissidents, but ordinary citizens looking for unfiltered information.",N/A,-1,-1
"Said Fisk:

Work on Lantern began more than three years ago, and getting the software to a public launch has been a long journey, which involved switching the underlying technology from SIP to a subset of WebRTC, and more recently moving away from Java and towards code written in Go.",N/A,-1,-1
"In those last three years, Lantern has been tested by more than 25,000 users, mostly located in Iran and China.",China,21,21
"And when the South China Morning Post wrote about Lantern late last year, censors immediately started to pay attention and blocked at least some users from using Lantern.",South China,3,4

"And when the South China Morning Post wrote about Lantern late last year, censors immediately started to pay attention and blocked at least some users from using Lantern.",China,4,4
"However, Fisk told me that Lantern s new architecture can withstand such attempts by combining cloud infrastructure with P2P, but he said that the app is still in an experimental stage, and that his team is looking for feedback from users to improve Lantern.",N/A,-1,-1
One other challenge for Lantern has been to secure funding.,N/A,-1,-1
"The project has been funded by the U.S. State Department, but it also depends on contributions from individual donors.",N/A,-1,-1
"And with little visibility in countries without internet censorship, fundraising efforts like an ongoing Indiegogo campaign have yet to take off.",N/A,-1,-1
Fisk told me that his group is now thinking about what else it can offer users in the U.S. and elsewhere.,N/A,-1,-1
One idea has already made it into the prototype stage: A physical lantern that combines an LED lamp with a Raspberry Pi computer that runs the actual proxy software.,N/A,-1,-1
"Every time a user in a censored country accesses a website through that proxy, the lantern lights up.",N/A,-1,-1
These physical lanterns could one day help to raise more funds   but raising awareness may be even more important to turn Lantern from an app capable of circumventing censorship into one that does so on a massive scale.,N/A,-1,-1

It even is used in Canada s air traffic control system and at NASA.,Canada,5,5
"And now that the internet of things is making messaging and sending data in real time so much more important, RTI CEO Stan Schneider is ready to take advantage of his company s history and software expertise.",N/A,-1,-1
"In February, the company launched a version of its software that would support more protocols that might be used by connected devices and sensors and also added support for more devices messaging.",N/A,-1,-1
"As Schneider noted in an interview, in a medical setting a hospital might need to coordinate data between 1,000 beds with 100 separate sensors sending information.",N/A,-1,-1
"That s a lot of coordination, but he believes the Data Distribution Service (DDS) protocol RTI is betting on is best able to handle that.",N/A,-1,-1
"Alternative protocols that are also vying to carry data traffic for the internet of things are MQTT, XMPP (Jabber) and the AMQP server-to-server messaging protocol.",N/A,-1,-1
"Based on GE Healthcare choosing RTI as the software provider inside its next generation of connected medical devices, RTI, or perhaps the DDS protocol, is apparently doing something right.",N/A,-1,-1
"RTI is also part of the Industrial Internet Consortium, the group founded by GE, Intel, Cisco, IBM and AT&T to build out reference architectures for the industrial internet, so it s possible that DDS might find a home there for medical settings.",Cisco,18,18
"Other companies such as PrismTech, Object Computing Inc. and others also build software around DDS as a sort of middleware platform to connect devices.",N/A,-1,-1
Schneider explained that in many industrial settings the device data stays in a mesh network between devices as opposed to going back up to the cloud.,N/A,-1,-1
"When you re matching the spin of a CT scan to a heartbeat, there s not a lot of room for latency.",N/A,-1,-1

Security in the cloud is on a lot of people s minds following the hacking of celebrities  iCloud accounts.,N/A,-1,-1
"When we hear about user accounts on cloud services and SaaS applications getting compromised, we start thinking more about he types of security capabilities that cloud providers offer versus what they leave unaddressed, and where responsibility should lie.",N/A,-1,-1
"Although many people think that security is a monolith, in reality it s much more of a mosaic   full of nuances and subtleties.",N/A,-1,-1
There are undoubtedly various kinds of threats associated with cloud services.,N/A,-1,-1
"From the perspective of the cloud service provider, the most pressing security issue involves protecting its back-end infrastructure from outside attackers.",N/A,-1,-1
An attacker who can break in through the back door can abscond with a wealth of data.,N/A,-1,-1
"Businesses using SaaS services, or individual users of iCloud, have other concerns.",N/A,-1,-1
"Account compromise through the back door is worrying, but in particular, organizations must worry about attacks through the front door.",N/A,-1,-1
User accounts may be compromised through phishing attacks (targeted or otherwise).,N/A,-1,-1
There s a risk of devices being lost or stolen.,N/A,-1,-1
Or end-user systems may be infected with malware that results in session hijacking.,N/A,-1,-1
Let s also remember that not all threats originate from the outside.,N/A,-1,-1
"What happens if malicious insiders decide to purloin sensitive data, like customer names and intellectual property, as they get ready to leave the company  And, along similar lines, how do you address inadvertent insiders   who may simply succumb to human error by mistyping an email address that causes data to be shared with someone who shouldn t have access to it  The list goes on.",N/A,-1,-1
"I mention this demarkation between front door and back door attacks because it seems to me that the lion s share of cloud service providers and SaaS vendors focus on protecting their back door, while taking more of a laissez-faire attitude about safeguarding the front door.",N/A,-1,-1
That stance is of little solace to organizations who need to be concerned about the full spectrum of threats to their data.,N/A,-1,-1
"These issues, while longstanding, can be addressed.",N/A,-1,-1
Front door attacks can be mitigated through a number of well understood mechanisms.,N/A,-1,-1
"For starters, two-factor authentication is common in many places, but not in all.",N/A,-1,-1
"It would be extremely helpful if we made this simple, but effective, approach more ubiquitous.",N/A,-1,-1
"Financial institutions have, for a long time, used fraud detection algorithms to identify account compromise and misuse.",N/A,-1,-1
The same techniques can be applied in the broader context of cloud services.,N/A,-1,-1
Encryption and data loss prevention tools have helped mitigate risks of data breaches when the enterprise perimeter was more well-defined.,N/A,-1,-1
Analogous approaches (assuming they are well thought through) can be applied in the context of cloud services.,N/A,-1,-1
"Finally, organizations would be considered foolish if they failed to scan files on endpoint systems for malware and viruses, yet they appear to have blinders on when those same files are in the cloud.",N/A,-1,-1
I think we are seeing the same fundamental misalignment of incentives for organizational data that we have seen play out in the world of consumer data.,N/A,-1,-1
"On the one hand, my cloud service provider or SaaS vendor has my organization s data.",N/A,-1,-1
"On the other hand, if my organization s data gets compromised, so long as it wasn t due to some inherent gross negligence on the part of the cloud service provider, then the onus is on me to deal with the ramifications.",N/A,-1,-1
"Unfortunately, I don t think we can reasonably expect that cloud service providers and SaaS vendors will take on the mantle of providing a more comprehensive set of security capabilities to customers.",N/A,-1,-1
"After all, how much would you trust an organization whose accounting department audited their own books 

That raises the question of what organizations need to do.",N/A,-1,-1
"For starters, being aware of the distinction between back-door protection and front-door protection goes a long way.",N/A,-1,-1
Organizations need to know what capabilities their SaaS vendor will provide and the point at which they need to fend for themselves.,N/A,-1,-1
They also need to understand what they can do to strengthen their half of the equation.,N/A,-1,-1
"My perspective is that net-net, the benefits of leveraging online services outweigh the risks.",N/A,-1,-1
"That said, for many, news of cloud account compromises can cast a shadow of doubt around using such online services.",N/A,-1,-1
"However, I like to take a more optimistic view.",N/A,-1,-1
These issues help more people crystallize their understanding of what leveraging the cloud provides (and doesn t provide).,N/A,-1,-1

Usually I d buy one when I went to lunch near a Barnes and Noble and forgot my iPad.,Noble,14,14
"Gradually, even my purchases of Zinio and Newsstand magazines dwindled to almost nothing.",N/A,-1,-1

This was a horrible idea.,N/A,-1,-1
"Because they were large graphics files, early tablets (and even today s tablets) struggled to display them.",N/A,-1,-1

Going after startups and developers is how I remember Google doing developer marketing in the old days.,N/A,-1,-1
Amazon has shown how this is a great route to adoption and enterprise.,N/A,-1,-1
MongoDB is another good example of the modern open source model.,N/A,-1,-1
AWS does go for bigger credits in other offers.,N/A,-1,-1
"In its annual AWS Challenge for example, winners get $50,000 in cash and $50,000 in cloud credits.",Challenge,4,4

"Microsoft Azure offers $200 in credit to new customers and participants in its Bizspark program get $150 per month in credits, but I m not aware of any bigger bucks promotions.",N/A,-1,-1

"But if all they lead to is a ton of unused resources, I m not really sure what the long-term benefit is for anyone.",N/A,-1,-1
"Microsoft, at any rate, is acutely aware of the shelfware problem that dogged it in the on-premises world and is working to minimize a repeat of that in cloud.",N/A,-1,-1

"Using software connected to the customized hardware, companies can now program their gear to take on specific tasks that the gear was not originally manufactured for, like analyzing data with Hadoop, ensuring that resources are optimized for the job at hand and not wasted, Ohara said.",N/A,-1,-1
It used to be that the different departments within a company   such as the business unit or the web services unit   directed the purchases of rack gear as opposed to a centralized data center team that can manage the entirety of a company s infrastructure.,N/A,-1,-1
"Because each department may have had different requirements from each other, the data center ended up being much more bloated than it should have been and resulted in what Ohara referred to as  stranded compute and storage all over the place.",N/A,-1,-1
"You need to have some group that is looking at the bigger picture,  Ohara said.",N/A,-1,-1
A group that looks at what is acquired and makes it work all together.,N/A,-1,-1
Consider the content delivery network (CDN) startup Fastly.,N/A,-1,-1
"For Fastly to be able to stream content in the quickest possible way while also ensuring that new servers come online to replace failed ones, the company had to design its own custom architecture, which spans 17 point-of-presence (POP) locations   the places where networks come together   across the globe.",N/A,-1,-1
"Fastly s pod setup consists of two racks comprised of servers and switches, the exact number of which is determined by the POP location and how much traffic occurs in each area, said Tom Daly, Fastly s vice president of infrastructure.",N/A,-1,-1
"If the company needs to add more resources to a particular POP or a major anchor site that receives a ton of traffic, like Fastly s San Jose, California, data center, it can simply drop in another two-rack pod and connect it to the rest of the system.",San Jose,27,28
"If the company needs to add more resources to a particular POP or a major anchor site that receives a ton of traffic, like Fastly s San Jose, California, data center, it can simply drop in another two-rack pod and connect it to the rest of the system.",California,30,30
"Because of improvements in technology over the past ten years, Fastly doesn t need a bunch of excess hardware like load balancing or router equipment to handle the task of quickly distributing information throughout the network in a reliable manner, explained Fastly VP of technology Hooman Beheshti.",N/A,-1,-1
He remembers a time when companies were at the mercy of whatever software came pre-stocked on hardware devices like a load balancer appliance.,N/A,-1,-1
"With the advent of software-defined networking techniques, however, Fastly can now customize the software running inside its Arista switches and reprogram them to take on more tasks than what they were designed for.",N/A,-1,-1
"Now, Fastly s switches and servers can do load balancing and can intelligently allocate traffic across the network.",N/A,-1,-1
"We took these machines, simplified everything, and wrote code and focused them toward our needs specifically,  said Beheshti.",N/A,-1,-1
"At Redapt, a company that helps organizations configure and build out their data centers, the emergence of the pod and core setup has come out of the technical challenges companies like those in the telecommunications industry face when having to expand their data centers, said Senior Vice President of Cloud Solutions Jeff Dickey.",Dickey,55,55
"By having the basic ingredients of a pod figured out per your organization s needs, it s just a matter of hooking together more pods in case you need to scale out, and now you aren t stuck with an excess amount of equipment you don t need, explained Dickey.",Dickey,52,52
"Redapt consults with customers on what they are trying to achieve in their data center and handles the legwork involved, such as ordering equipment from hardware vendors and setting up the gear into customized racks.",N/A,-1,-1
Dickey said that Redapt typically uses an eight-rack-pod configuration to power up application workloads of a similar nature (like multiple data-processing tasks).,Dickey,0,0
"With this setup, it s easy to keep track of the various pod configurations that a company might use so that if one were to discover it needs more compute for better performance, the company can buy another pod tailored to handling powerful processing as opposed to a pod that might be better suited for storage-related tasks.",N/A,-1,-1
"I m trying to say,  Hey this is what works; let s not spend the next eight months customizing Frankencloud,   said Dickey.",Dickey,24,24
"For file-sharing startup Egnyte s three data centers, the company uses four pods that each contain four racks that handle compute, storage and networking, said Kris Lahiri, Egnyte s VP of operations and chief security officer.",N/A,-1,-1
The startup also has an additional two pods in each data center with which it can try out more advanced features or do quality assurance checks and testing.,N/A,-1,-1
Egnyte runs an algorithm to distribute its customers  data across the pods and has a dashboard that logs the performance for each pod so it can tell whether or not one is spiking or suffering from an outage.,N/A,-1,-1
"This is important for the startup, because its clients can be dropping in terabytes of data into Egnyte s system without notice and by having all the pods hooked up together and monitored, Egnyte can react to sudden changes.",N/A,-1,-1
"Instead of looking at the entire gamut of data centers, you break it down by a data center and then you break it down by a pod,  said Lahiri.",N/A,-1,-1
"Egnyte configured the compute section of each of its pods to take on heavy processing tasks, like encryption, indexing with Elasticsearch and setting up user permissions and access details.",N/A,-1,-1
"While setting up basic administrative controls for user data may seem like a relatively easy task, doing so actually requires a lot of processing power when one wants to apply the same internal IT configurations to multiple clouds, explained Lahiri.",N/A,-1,-1
"In this case, Egnyte was able to tie in the open source Puppet (see disclosure) configuration-management tool to its data center so that the same administration permissions a company wants to carry over from its internal IT systems will be carried over to the Egnyte cloud.",N/A,-1,-1
"Beyond improving Egnyte s data center efficiency, Lahiri said the new way of building data centers has prevented vendor lock-in.",N/A,-1,-1
"While the startup currently uses a mix of Dell servers and Supermicro hardware for storage, if one day it decides to use different gear, it s going to be a lot easier to swap out appliances than in the past, because Egnyte can just reprogram the gear and have the IT management software handle everything in the same way.",N/A,-1,-1
"Fastly s Daly shares a similar sentiment and said that having the ability to buy custom hardware, modify it with software and then place that hardware into pods provides a much better method of running a data center, because you are no longer relegated to having to use the same gear in the exact same way as a company in a different industry might.",N/A,-1,-1
"Of course, building your own pod and core setup isn t cheap.",N/A,-1,-1
"According to Dickey, Redapt can charge anywhere from $200,000 to $600,000 for a fully loaded rack; multiply that by the typical eight-pod configuration and you re seeing a bill that s in the millions of dollars.",Dickey,2,2
"But for companies that want full control of how their infrastructure functions, using a pod and core setup powered by software is worth the effort.",N/A,-1,-1
"This is essentially like doing an Amazon cloud yourself,  said Lahiri.",N/A,-1,-1
"Amazon is, of course, doing it at a much larger scale, but technically you are doing the same thing.",N/A,-1,-1
"Disclosure: Puppet Labs is backed by True Ventures, a venture capital firm that is an investor in the parent company of this blog, Gigaom.",N/A,-1,-1
"If you spent much time in the tech Twittersphere Tuesday, you probably were barraged by a flood of  my first Hyperlapse  videos.",N/A,-1,-1

"Hyperlapse seems to have caught people s imagination more than Bolt, Instagram s first standalone app release.",N/A,-1,-1
"In much the same way that Instagram s filters made every average Joe feel like a professional photographer, Hyperlapse s steadycam time-lapse turns the masses into mini Hollywood producers.",Hollywood,28,28
"It s a new form of storytelling: Speeding up shots 2x, 4x, or even 13x injects new feeling into previously drab video footage.",N/A,-1,-1
"Playing with time changes the sentiment of a clip, from comical to serene to harried.",N/A,-1,-1
"There s even already a roundup of the 20 most creative Hyperlapses (creepy bugs and dance routines abound), and the app has only been out a day.",N/A,-1,-1
"I immediately knew where I wanted to test Hyperlapse out  my favorite spot in all of San Francisco, a tiny pier off the Embarcadero.",San Francisco,16,17
"I had tried to capture the beauty of the view before by video, but it s not particularly exciting for people to watch a static shot of water and some sailboats.",N/A,-1,-1
Time-lapse could bring it to life.,N/A,-1,-1
"Not exactly Spielberg, but I was still proud of it.",N/A,-1,-1
"As you might expect from a product of the Instagram shop, the user interface design of Hyperlapse is elegant, simple, and self-explanatory.",N/A,-1,-1
"After the app walks you through setup and permissions, you re prompted to hit the record button and take a video in the normal way.",N/A,-1,-1
"After you finish, the app previews the clip for you and you can experiment with different speeds to see how it changes the look and feel of the video.",N/A,-1,-1
"Once you ve selected your desired speed, the app saves the now-time-lapsed video to your camera roll and gives you the option to share the video on Instagram or Facebook.",N/A,-1,-1
Time-lapse makes a video far more dynamic.,N/A,-1,-1
"It s an easier way to capture things that might otherwise be boring in motion: Beautiful scenery, movements of crowds, an animal perusing its surroundings.",N/A,-1,-1
I could see a feature like this increasing the frequency with which people shoot video to share with friends.,N/A,-1,-1
"The only downside to Hyperlapse s technology is that the video is downgraded to a rather grainy quality, making shots look cheap, like something out of a 1990 s home video.",N/A,-1,-1
But just because the app is a cool little feature that makes video storytelling more fun doesn t mean it will necessarily succeed with the masses.,N/A,-1,-1
"Instagram followed the current trend of app unbundling, deciding to release Hyperlapse as a separate experience instead of incorporating the feature into the current Instagram app and cluttering up the user experience.",N/A,-1,-1
"It makes sense, but without appearing automatically in the 200 million monthly active Instagram users  apps, Hyperlapse will have an uphill battle to fight for gaining mindshare.",N/A,-1,-1

Zuli has a pretty cool idea to make a connected outlet a bit more interesting for smart home aficionados.,N/A,-1,-1
The company uses proprietary software that creates a Bluetooth mesh network.,N/A,-1,-1

One of the values of such a mesh is that it offers presence detection for people who have three or more Zuli outlets spread throughout their home.,N/A,-1,-1
"They essentially act like beacons, communicating where a person is in relation to the plugs.",N/A,-1,-1

"The round, which has been rumored for months, will reportedly value the company at $10 billion.",N/A,-1,-1
The news was accompanied by more news: Snapchat has hit 100 million monthly active users.,N/A,-1,-1
"When asked for comment by WSJ, a Snapchat spokesperson threw a little sass,  The valuation of our business and our capital requirements are the least exciting aspects of supporting the Snapchat community.",N/A,-1,-1
We have no further comment at this time.,N/A,-1,-1
One source told the WSJ that Kleiner would be throwing in up to $20 million.,N/A,-1,-1
"The round hasn t closed yet, so it s possible the situation could shift.",N/A,-1,-1
"It was only last month that there were reports Alibaba might be leading Snapchat s round, a rumor that didn t prove out.",N/A,-1,-1
Kleiner has been struggling to find its footing for some time now and cut a sizable chunk of its early stage investment staff late last year.,N/A,-1,-1
"The company, under John Doerr s guidance, went big on cleantech and suffered some serious losses (the Segway anyone ).",N/A,-1,-1
"It largely missed the wave on social, passing up Facebook and LinkedIn and taking a later stage bet in Twitter.",N/A,-1,-1
"The Snapchat deal may be a way to make back some of those losses, although joining in on the Series D isn t exactly calling it early.",N/A,-1,-1
Uber has grown from a scrappy little startup fighting the taxi man to an entrenched behemoth sucker-punching its pink mustachioed equal.,N/A,-1,-1
"That s right, in part three of the on-demand transportation industry s version of the Darth Vader vs. Luke Skywalker trilogy, Uber s national campaign to undermine Lyft has been unmasked by The Verge.",Luke,20,20
Spoiler alert: It s a doozy.,N/A,-1,-1
"Although it has been reported before that Uber employees frequently hop in cars with Lyft drivers and try to woo them to switch companies, the extent of the program wasn t clear.",N/A,-1,-1
"Was it a handful of rogue employees  A mandate from Travis Kalanick himself  A local endeavor or a national one 

According to The Verge, it s a widespread campaign so big it has its own name: SLOG.",N/A,-1,-1
That s a terrible choice of name; you can imagine someone leaning back in their chair cackling maniacally while saying it.,N/A,-1,-1

"There s a lot of weird and shocking little anecdotes to the program, which The Verge learned about through Uber contractors hired to do the dirty work.",N/A,-1,-1
They re called   a much sparklier name than SLOG   brand ambassadors.,N/A,-1,-1

"How is Amazon s first smartphone selling  According to a new estimate from Charles Arthur at the Guardian, not well.",Arthur,14,14
"Combining web usage data from Chitika and data from ComScore, he estimated an upper limit of 35,000 Fire Phones sold and in current usage.",N/A,-1,-1
"It s impossible to confirm whether Arthur s artificial estimate is actually in the right ballpark, because Amazon does not release sales numbers.",Arthur,6,6
"But if the figure is close, it would also suggest that Amazon sells very few on-contract phones through its website, even those made by other manufacturers like Samsung.",N/A,-1,-1
"Although Amazon does not release sales numbers, it does publish hourly updated lists of top-selling products in various categories.",N/A,-1,-1
"Take a look at Amazon s bestselling contract cell phones: the 32 GB Fire Phone is in first place, as it has been since launch day.",N/A,-1,-1
"But flip over to the chart for best selling electronics in general, and you won t find the Fire Phone   on contract or unlocked   anywhere on the top 100, although there are Amazon tablets represented there, as well as a few inexpensive unlocked smartphones.",N/A,-1,-1
"If the Fire Phone tops Amazon s bestselling contract cell phone list with an estimated maximum of 35,000 devices sold in a month, even with premium front page placement on Amazon.com, the number two device   the Galaxy S5 with Verizon service   probably isn t doing gangbusters either.",N/A,-1,-1
There s anecdotal evidence to back this up as well.,N/A,-1,-1
"Quartz s Dan Frommer writes that an NPD Group representative told him,  Amazon is not a factor in sales of smartphones in the United States.",N/A,-1,-1
"Like retail giants Wal-Mart and Best Buy, Amazon is an authorized retailer for service plans and devices from AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint.",Mart,4,4
It s been in this space since 2009.,N/A,-1,-1
"There are a variety of reasons why consumers might not want their next device from Amazon: Return policies and fine print, as well as tasks like grandfathering your old contract or porting a number across carriers, become more complicated when you go through a third-party reseller.",N/A,-1,-1
People might really prefer to upgrade their devices in person.,N/A,-1,-1
And Amazon does not sell iPhones on contract.,N/A,-1,-1
But using Amazon s wireless storefront is actually a pleasant experience   with common options clearly laid out   and has a decent selection across all carriers.,N/A,-1,-1
"Plus, it frequently runs deals that undercut the carriers.",N/A,-1,-1
"So it might be that online on-contract retailing is just not a great business: One big independent online reseller, LetsTalk, is no longer taking orders at all.",N/A,-1,-1
As recently as three years ago Wirefly described itself as a  the Internet s number one authorized retailer of cell phones and plans  but now it s a comparison service that just links out to the carriers.,N/A,-1,-1
"Amazon used to have a standalone storefront called Amazon Wireless for its carrier contract products, complete with a link in the homepage footer next to Zappos and Woot, but on-contract phones have since been folded into the main website.",N/A,-1,-1
The apparent weakness of Amazon s wireless business calls into question the overall strategy that brought the Fire Phone to market.,N/A,-1,-1
The up-front cost of the Fire Phone   $650   means that buying it on contract is the only realistic option for most people.,N/A,-1,-1
"It s easy to assume that Amazon, since it is an e-commerce behemoth that sells everything, would sell a bunch of Fire Phones as well.",N/A,-1,-1
But a high-end phone on contract is a more complicated purchase than a Kindle.,N/A,-1,-1
"Before the Fire Phone was launched, some observers predicted that it would be sold unlocked or with some kind of innovative plan that would shake up the current postpaid subsidy paradigm.",N/A,-1,-1
"Instead, the Fire Phone is sold through the same subsidy system that predates the original iPhone, but with a heavy emphasis on online sales because, well, it s Amazon.",N/A,-1,-1
Perhaps Amazon doesn t put much weight on its on-contract cell phone sales or it s planning to emphasize the unlocked Fire Phone after a price cut or an update.,N/A,-1,-1
But when it launched the standalone Amazon Wireless storefront in 2009 it certainly seemed like a targeted growth area for the company.,N/A,-1,-1
It s not crazy for a device maker or retailer to embrace the current American upgrade cycle and postpaid landscape   Apple has recently been looking to pump up retail iPhone sales in its physical and online stores as well.,N/A,-1,-1
Perhaps one of the myriad conflicting goals behind the Fire Phone was to establish that it s realistic to buy an on-contract phone online from Amazon.,N/A,-1,-1
"If so, it doesn t seem to have worked so far.",N/A,-1,-1
This article has been updated to clarify that the Fire Phone is available from other retailers in addition to Amazon and AT&T.,N/A,-1,-1
"Before I consider my home smart, I m going to need to replace my appliances.",N/A,-1,-1
"While the smart fridge is a clich , having a smarter kitchen (that might include the fridge) or a washer and dryer that are connected to my air conditioning system will make my home more energy-efficient and could help me take full advantage of my appliances.",N/A,-1,-1
The question is how and when will this happen.,N/A,-1,-1
"Appliances aren t something consumers buy every couple of years, and when they do, connectivity isn t something most are willing to pay extra for in 2014.",N/A,-1,-1
"Even if they do pay for  smart  overs or dishwashers, there s still a lot of uncertainty over what platforms will ultimately win.",N/A,-1,-1
"Who wants to buy a smart fridge that becomes dumb in three years 

To figure out how one appliance vendor is thinking through these questions, I spoke with Chris Quatrochi, Director of Global Consumer Design at Whirlpool to understand how adding connectivity to the company s products changes the business but also how it views the smart home.",N/A,-1,-1
"Unsurprisingly, Quatrochi believes the smart home is a big opportunity and that the time has finally come for it to arrive.",N/A,-1,-1
This a topic we ll explore in considerable depth at our Structure Connect event Oct. 21 and 22 in San Francisco.,San Francisco,19,20
"After telling me about this 1957 video produced by Whirlpool that presages the smart kitchen, Quatrochi said that the dream of a smarter home has been longstanding.",N/A,-1,-1
"But with the acquisition of Nest by Google for $3.2 billion and the influx of products and standards, its clear there s an immense increase in interest.",N/A,-1,-1
"However, adding connectivity to a washing machine is a complicated endeavor for a variety of reasons.",N/A,-1,-1
Let s start with costs.,N/A,-1,-1
"Unlike a computer, adding Wi-Fi to an appliance can add a noticeable upticks in cost.",N/A,-1,-1
"That s because most appliances sport relatively dumb chips, such as 8-bit or 16-bit microcontrollers.",N/A,-1,-1
"As silicon brains go, they aren t really sufficient for managing the software and radios needed by a smart appliance, which means the vendor has to shell out for a higher end microcontroller.",N/A,-1,-1
"This will happen over time, but it s expensive.",N/A,-1,-1
And Quatrochi has to justify that expense.,N/A,-1,-1
"Compared to a $300 or $400 cell phone, the electronics in a washing machine are stone age in nature with tech appropriate for what that device does.",N/A,-1,-1
"Essentially, appliances aren t very smart,  Quatrochi said.",N/A,-1,-1
"He estimates that adding intelligence to devices like a dishwasher might add $5 in costs to Whirlpool, but it also represents a trade-off.",N/A,-1,-1
"For example, Whirlpool could spend $5 on connectivity that only some people might use or spend it on developing a better sanitizing cycle in a dishwasher.",N/A,-1,-1
"And while many companies who offer clients like Whirlpool back-end cloud offerings, will argue that Whirlpool gains by adding connectivity because now it can understand how clients are using the dishwasher or fridge and can also later use that connectivity to offer services down the line, Quatrochi is adamant that any costs added to the manufacture of an appliance will add value to the end consumer.",N/A,-1,-1
"We re not expecting the client to cover the cost for us to get a better service element,  Quatrochi said.",N/A,-1,-1
"If we are not providing a very demonstrable benefit that meets our brand guidelines, then we won t put it on the appliance.",N/A,-1,-1
"For Whirlpool those brand guidelines sound a bit cheesy    turning every chore into an act of love    but the net result is that if something doesn t make a chore less time consuming, more pleasant, or easier then it has no place on the product.",N/A,-1,-1
"However, Quatrochi is thinking about how to use connectivity to make chores easier.",N/A,-1,-1
In many cases that means adding context and sharing information across devices in the home.,N/A,-1,-1
"For example, Whirlpool is a Nest developer partner, and Quatrochi can see a time when your oven might tell your thermostat that it s on and it should lower the set point to keep the home cool.",N/A,-1,-1
It also could delay the start time of your washer or dryer if your thermostat is being controlled by your utility as part of a demand response program.,N/A,-1,-1
"But even more interesting, context provided by your interactions with one appliance or web service might help you discover new settings or options in your other appliances.",N/A,-1,-1
"For example, what if you shopped for baby food often and your grocery list or fridge was able to tell your washing machine that you had a baby in your home.",N/A,-1,-1
Your washing machine might suggest the sanitizing cycle as an option since baby clothes are often cleaned on that cycle.,N/A,-1,-1
"Over the last 100 years whenever you bought an appliance, 20 years later it did exactly the same thing  said Quatrochi.",N/A,-1,-1
But what if it didn t have to  What if it was able to change  That starts to open a variety of possibilities.,N/A,-1,-1
"Quatrochi was reluctant to go much deeper into that thought or the services that might ensue, but it s easy to see where context and a relationship between devices in your home and even with services out side your home might lead to shifts in what we define as an appliance or even what it means to own an appliance.",N/A,-1,-1
And once something is connected it becomes an obligation.,N/A,-1,-1
"While Whirlpool has been around for a century, it is thinking about how it will handle connected devices that might need to live in people s homes for a decade or longer.",N/A,-1,-1
"The connected space is changing fast and if it costs us money ten to twenty years down the road to keep servicing the customer, we might think about charging the consumer,  Quatrochi said.",N/A,-1,-1
But our desire to keep offering our customers additional value over time with that connection.,N/A,-1,-1
"That might not be a tough sell for the early adopters, of whom Quatrochi said,  Part of the value that a user sees in connected capability is access to the undiscovered future.",N/A,-1,-1
I like that phrase because it conveys the promise and the uncertainty that we re heading toward with ubiquitous connectivity on every device.,N/A,-1,-1
"And when it comes to platforms and other trying to capture a bit of that promise, Quatrochi is staying neutral.",N/A,-1,-1
"The reality for us is to make sure we re flexible enough to connect for what s coming out winning,  Quatrochi said.",N/A,-1,-1
The home control is quite fragmented and will continue to be more fragmented and then likely collapse.,N/A,-1,-1
"He estimates that will take between three and five years and at the end,  We ll see Apple and Android with home control built into it, and some things like Wink and other big box platforms potentially become obsolete.",N/A,-1,-1
"In the meantime, he is focused on bringing connectivity to Whirlpool products and figuring out how to build that undiscovered future.",N/A,-1,-1
"And unfortunately for me, who just bought new appliances in 2012, Quatrochi isn t optimistic about a connectivity retrofit for existing products.",N/A,-1,-1
"We are looking at that option and it s a hit or miss depending on the appliance,  he said.",N/A,-1,-1
Well have to look at it on a one-by-one basis.,N/A,-1,-1
Looks like Whirlpool is making smart decisions.,N/A,-1,-1
And that my house will continue to be dumb for a while longer.,N/A,-1,-1
Apple s iPhone might not be the only iOS device to get a bigger screen: a trio of Bloomberg reporters are suggesting that Apple will debut a 12.9-inch iPad in early 2015.,N/A,-1,-1
"This isn t the first time we ve heard this rumor, so it s possible it s just that: A rumor.",N/A,-1,-1
"Still, there s merit to the idea of a larger iPad, although a 12.9-inch model could have wider appear than a 24-inch version.",N/A,-1,-1
"For one thing, the rate of iPad sales has slowed a bit over the past quarter or two.",N/A,-1,-1
It s possible that most people who want a 7.9- or 9.7-inch iPad already have one and aren t willing to drop several hundred dollars more on a slightly refreshed model.,N/A,-1,-1
"But a 12.9-inch iPad is a completely different device, and that could spur sales.",N/A,-1,-1
"Such a product could also help more people transition from a traditional computing device to a tablet, particularly if iOS 8 brings support for running multiple apps on screen at the same time.",N/A,-1,-1
The benefit of this multitasking is more evident on a larger-screened device: It could work on the iPad mini but would work better on a tablet with a bigger display.,N/A,-1,-1
"Again, like so many other Apple reports, this is conjecture for now.",N/A,-1,-1
But I wouldn t be surprised at all if Apple introduces a larger iPad within the next six months.,N/A,-1,-1
It would surely give the company s tablet sales a boost while also giving people one less reason to buy a traditional computer.,N/A,-1,-1
"Of course, Apple is willing to sell those too, but iOS devices now make up far more of the company s revenues and profits.",N/A,-1,-1
Over the next two years companies will shift resources towards mobility initiatives and move ownership of mobile operations from outsourced production agencies towards in-house hybrid models.,N/A,-1,-1
Internal management will take on more of the responsibility for understanding and supporting the high expectations of the rapidly expanding mobile-enabled customer segment.,N/A,-1,-1
This trend will in turn drive innovation in mobile commerce as retailers and the technology providers that work with them focus on both enhancing the customer s mobile experience to protect and extend their brands and building loyalty and increasing sales conversion rates.,N/A,-1,-1
Currently leaders like Starbucks are partnering with mobile-first technology platforms like Square as well as developing their own mobile-commerce platforms and business systems to create a rewarding and seamless mobile experience for the user.,N/A,-1,-1
"While other retailers can learn from such examples, they must also take a hard look at which app or mobile web strategies are appropriate for their business.",N/A,-1,-1
"The size of the mobile commerce market is growing, but only those companies that execute properly will gain any traction.",N/A,-1,-1
"When Square launched its Cash peer-to-peer payments service last year, it made transferring funds as simple as sending an email.",N/A,-1,-1
Apparently that wasn t easy enough.,N/A,-1,-1
A new update to Square Cash now lets customers transfer funds through a text message.,N/A,-1,-1
Square doesn t use SMS to actually move money around.,N/A,-1,-1
"Rather, it links customers  Cash accounts and their associated debit cards to a phone number   just as it previously linked them to an email address   and uses SMS as the notification and verification tool.",N/A,-1,-1
"While Cash users could make an email payment through any web, mobile or PC email client, the SMS service requires the Square smartphone app (available on iOS and Android).",N/A,-1,-1
You can send funds through the Cash client to anyone in your phone s contact list or just enter a phone number.,N/A,-1,-1
"The recipient, in turn,  receives an SMS notification of the pending transfer.",N/A,-1,-1
"If the recipient is a Cash user, the funds will automatically be deposited in his or her account (often as quickly as minutes, though sometimes after 1-2 business days).",N/A,-1,-1
"If not, the payee is prompted to create an account, either online or through the Cash app.",N/A,-1,-1
"As I wrote before, Square is trying to bring its sleek and painless approach to point-of-sale payments to peer-to-peer payments, challenging PayPal on its own turf.",N/A,-1,-1
"Cash was already easy to use, it s becoming more functional with SMS support and the ability to attach notes to each payment, and unlike Square s competitors, Cash still charges no transaction fees.",N/A,-1,-1
But that simplicity also raises even more questions about how secure its network can be.,N/A,-1,-1
"Just as an email address can be spoofed, so can a phone number.",N/A,-1,-1
"Square claims that it has much tighter security technology working in the background than the service s simplicity would appear to suggest, and the same fraud protection systems that identify bogus charges on its merchant network are also monitoring the Cash network.",N/A,-1,-1
Square also imposes limits on how much money can be transferred daily.,N/A,-1,-1
"If you re willing to put your trust in Square Cash, the service might be worth checking out   if only for the free $1 Square will transfer into your account for verification purposes.",N/A,-1,-1
Google on Monday released the latest in a string of text datasets designed to make it easier for people outside its hallowed walls to build applications that can make sense of all the words surrounding them.,N/A,-1,-1
"As explained in a blog post, the company analyzed the New York Times Annotated Corpus   a collection of millions of articles spanning 20 years, tagged for properties such as people, places and things mentioned   and created a dataset that ranks the salience (or relative importance) of every name mentioned in each one of those articles.",York,12,12
"As explained in a blog post, the company analyzed the New York Times Annotated Corpus   a collection of millions of articles spanning 20 years, tagged for properties such as people, places and things mentioned   and created a dataset that ranks the salience (or relative importance) of every name mentioned in each one of those articles.",New York,11,12
"Essentially, the goal with the dataset is to give researchers a base understanding of which entities are important within particular pieces of content, an understanding that should then be complemented with background data sources that will provide even more information.",N/A,-1,-1
"So while the number of times a person or company is mentioned in an article can be a very strong sign of which words are important   especially when compared to the usual mention count for that word, one of the early methods for ranking search results   a more telling method of ranking importance would also leverage existing knowledge of broader concepts to capture important words that don t stand out from a volume perspective.",N/A,-1,-1
"For example, in an article about NBA coach Becky Hammon, the blog post s authors explain:

  Basketball  is more than a string of characters; it is a reference to something in the real word which we already already know quite a bit about.",Hammon,10,10
Background information about entities ought to help us decide which of them are most salient.,N/A,-1,-1
"After all, an article s author assumes her readers have some general understanding of the world, and probably a bit about sports too.",N/A,-1,-1
"Using background knowledge, we might be able to infer that the WNBA is a salient entity in the Becky Hammon article even though it only appears once .",Hammon,20,20
Features like mention count and document positioning give reasonable salience predictions.,N/A,-1,-1
"But because they only describe what s explicitly in the document, we expect a system that uses background information to expose what s implicit could give better results.",N/A,-1,-1
"This type of work is important, because although there s a lot of talk about advances in artificial intelligence, the truth is that we have a long way to go before machines can match human capabilities.",N/A,-1,-1
"As the post s authors also note,  Reading comes pretty easily to people   we can quickly identify the places or things or people most central to a piece of text.",Reading,8,8
"But how might we teach a machine to perform this same task  

The end results of accomplishing this mission (and accomplishing it well) will include better search results, sure, but possibly better science and medicine, as well.",N/A,-1,-1
"A team of researchers from IBM and Baylor College of Medicine just published a paper as part of the KDD 2014 conference that details work they did to analyze more than 70,000 scholarly articles about a particular protein using IBM s Watson system.",College,8,8
"The program they created, called KnIT, analyzed the relationships between the target protein and others based (this is a simplified explanation) on how often and closely they appear in the articles.",N/A,-1,-1
The system predicted seven out of nine proteins that have since been determined as important in the realm of tumor suppression.,N/A,-1,-1

"He also discussed a project called Semantic Scholar, which is similar in aim to the IBM-Baylor one, except that it wants to enable semantic search over scholarly papers so researchers don t need to nail their keywords in order to find what they want over an ever-growing body of work.",N/A,-1,-1
"Going back to the WNBA example in Google s work, one could imagine searching for papers about the league and missing one that only used the exact term sparingly   if at all   but is nonetheless very relevant.",N/A,-1,-1

"One of the Baylor researchers, quoted in a press release about its work with IBM, explained the promise of all this work to build systems that can start to understand what text is actually about:  A computer certainly may not reason as well as a scientist but the little it can, logically and objectively, may contribute greatly when applied to our entire body of knowledge.",N/A,-1,-1

"(Right now, the rates are 1.7 percent of revenues for AM/FM radio stations and 1.85 percent for Pandora.",N/A,-1,-1

The Justice Department imposed the consent decrees in the first place as a matter of antitrust law after finding that ASCAP and BMI had monopoly-type powers when it came to song licensing.",Justice,2,2

"In response to the initial comment period, which closed last week, ASCAP and BMI offered up three suggestions   the first of which could be a death sentence for internet radio stations like Pandora.",N/A,-1,-1
"That suggestion is to let music publishers, which control the songs licensed through ASCAP and BMI, dodge the consent decree obligations when it comes to digital song rights.",N/A,-1,-1
"For practical purposes, this would mean that big publishers like Sony or Warner could force Pandora to negotiate one-on-one for access to their song catalogs   while at the same time using ASCAP and BMI to collect royalties at the usual fixed rate from AM/FM stations, and from other companies that perform music such as restaurants, clubs and bowling alleys.",Warner,13,13
One problem with this suggestion is that excluding digital song rights from the royalty scheme is exactly what a federal court judge recently said the music industry can t do.,N/A,-1,-1

The reason that this figure is so much higher than the 1.8 percent rate required by ASCAP is that digital music services must pay a king s ransom for another type of performance royalty rights   called sound recording rights   that non-digital services don t have to pay at all.,N/A,-1,-1

"Comcast and the other cable companies involved in the blackout lawsuits say the arbitration rules should apply, but Scheindlin disagreed, saying arbitration rules are not relevant in the case of antitrust issues.She also emphasized that the arbitration rules did not apply to the NHL and MLB in the first place, and said the leagues  request for a stay was based on  multiple layers of highly optimistic speculation.",N/A,-1,-1
"Taken together, the rulings are important because they suggests that authorities are growing skeptical of rules that give powerful sports leagues a free pass on ordinary anti-trust rules.",N/A,-1,-1
"More importantly, for fans, the end of blackouts could mean not just more games, but lower prices   the judge reportedly cited an expert who claims game packages could cost 50 percent less if there was true competition in the sports market.",N/A,-1,-1
"For the leagues, however, a new legal limit on blackouts would be a big blow to their business strategy, which relies on slicing up the TV and digital rights to their games in very selective fashion.",N/A,-1,-1
"Specifically, restrictions on blackouts would make it harder to charge the monopoly premiums for cable packages that live sports can command.",N/A,-1,-1
"For now, though, it s soon to say if   or when   the blackouts will come to an end.",N/A,-1,-1

"My fear, and that of some others I have spoken to about it, is that these collaborative lists could create a slippery-slope problem and wind up generating a kind of reverse mob effect, in which some users wind up being blocked by large numbers of people for reasons that aren t quite clear, or don t really meet the standard of abuse and harassment.",N/A,-1,-1

This post was updated on Tuesday at 3 pm ET after Quartz clarified its interpretation of the automated-account numbers that Twitter released in its 10-Q.,N/A,-1,-1
We ve asked Twitter for comment and will post it if and when we get any.,N/A,-1,-1
"When Twitter released its second-quarter financial results, investors seemed pleased: revenue was up by more than 120 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, and user growth seemed favorable.",N/A,-1,-1
"But there was one number that was a bit of a red flag   namely, the number of users who never visit the website or use Twitter s official apps, because they are pulling tweets in automatically through some kind of third-party service.",N/A,-1,-1
"The problem being that those users will never see any advertising, Twitter s primary revenue source.",N/A,-1,-1
"The company has now updated its numbers on automated accounts to note that they are lower than it previously said they were: A revised filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission states that while Twitter told investors that 14 percent of its estimated 270 million active users access the network via a third-party or automated service, further analysis shows that this number is closer to 11 percent, and only 8.5 percent use an automated method to read tweets.",N/A,-1,-1
"Contrary to what Quartz originally reported, this doesn t mean that more than 20 million of Twitter s users are all bots, just that those accounts use some kind of external method for accessing tweets   a notification layer built into a phone, for example   as opposed to going to the Twitter website directly or using one of the company s official mobile apps.",N/A,-1,-1
"This means they aren t necessarily the same as accounts that post tweets to the service automatically, in some cases based on an external signal of some kind   such as the @StealthMountain bot, which used to post a tweet whenever someone misspelled the phrase  sneak peek  (it is no longer active) or an account called @EarthquakesSF tweets whenever the USGS detects an earthquake.",N/A,-1,-1
The conventional wisdom is that these kinds of accounts are useless because they can t consume advertising.,N/A,-1,-1
But some of them are likely very useful to Twitter.,N/A,-1,-1
"For example, many brand accounts use automated services like SocialFlow to post tweets automatically when the algorithm detects that people are discussing a certain topic or product.",N/A,-1,-1
"That may seem like spam to some, but it also meets that advertiser s needs of reaching out to potentially interested users   and if they see enough interest, they may even sign up for some promoted tweets.",N/A,-1,-1
"The other potential benefit of bots is a bit more nebulous, and that is the engagement created by  Weird Twitter  bots such as @KimKierkegaard, which mashes up statements from celebrity tweeter Kim Kardashian with those from the existential Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard   or another popular account called @everyword, which did nothing but tweet a single word until it had gone through every word in the dictionary.",N/A,-1,-1
"Again, these bots might seem like spam to some, but others (including me) enjoy the randomness they exhibit, and that likely keeps a certain number of users checking and refreshing Twitter.",N/A,-1,-1
"In the end, increasing engagement by actual humans is the number one challenge for Twitter, and if tweets from automated accounts help to do that, whether they are branded tweets or random bits of weirdness, then so much the better for Twitter and its investors.",N/A,-1,-1

"Yo, the app that lets you send folks a simple  Yo,  has gone from being a one-trick pony to attempting to become a hub for all kinds of notifications with an app update on Tuesday.",N/A,-1,-1
"Yes, it looks a bit like If This Then That (IFTTT)   and that means it s one of many startups that are attempting to aggregate a slew of web services, from Pinterest to Instagram, under one app.",N/A,-1,-1
It s no longer enough to have notifications on your phone.,N/A,-1,-1
"As we connect more things to the internet, we ll have more notifications, and we ll probably also want to see those notifications in more places.",N/A,-1,-1

Or you may want to see your texts or Instagrams on your television as you cook dinner with it in the background.,N/A,-1,-1
"That need for notifications, and the need for them to be in a simple and easy to consume format, is the impetus behind Yo, Numerous, Numerics, and scads of other apps trying to deliver snippets of information for a variety of screens   from those on your wrist to those on your wall.",N/A,-1,-1
"But, even as these apps proliferate they face a number of challenges.",N/A,-1,-1
"One of the conveniences they are trying to offer users is a single place for ever more notifications coming from web services, but also from connected devices.",N/A,-1,-1
Your Withings Pulse might send you a Yo when you need to get off your butt and walk more.,N/A,-1,-1
I built a similar recipe using IFTTT that turned power to my television off if I didn t meet my step goals for the day.,N/A,-1,-1
"Right now, you have to program these things yourself, which limits their utility to a select group of people who really want to get a Yo when their server goes down or who have colleagues who want a Yo when it s time to hit a daily meeting.",N/A,-1,-1
IFTTT has a similar issue.,N/A,-1,-1
Everyone thinks I am nuts for using it until I find the use case that appeals to them.,N/A,-1,-1
For my mom it s stock movement notifications tied to a smart light bulb or outlet.,N/A,-1,-1
For my sister-in-law it s getting an email when Craigslist posts something she s set an alert for.,N/A,-1,-1
The confusion about why someone needs notifications and the need to program these services limits their adoption for now.,N/A,-1,-1
I tend to think of them as a first-generation solution to the problem of too many devices and information overload.,N/A,-1,-1
The obvious next-generation offering will be something built with more ambient information delivery (like the light flickering when a stock moves) or even your phone shouting  Yo  to remind you of a meeting so you don t have to check the screen.,N/A,-1,-1
But the second element will be how devices figure out when to deliver those cues.,N/A,-1,-1
And that will require some amount of cooperation.,N/A,-1,-1
"Each of us does some crazy redundant task all day long, whether it s tracking your weight or flipping over to check your email.",N/A,-1,-1
With connectivity and intelligence provided in the cloud your scale can tell that you step on it twice a week.,N/A,-1,-1
At that point it can offer suggestions through the app of likely recipes and then implement them.,N/A,-1,-1
"For example, you might get an offer to link your scale to a spreadsheet or your fitness tracker or Google s Android Fit (or Apple s Health Kit).",N/A,-1,-1
"There s no searching for devices you may own or dreaming up recipes, just a suggestion that you can accept and follow through with directly in the app you are using at the time.",N/A,-1,-1
"While these suggestions make sense from a usability standpoint, right now we re stuck because that level of cooperation means that companies may lose users of their own apps and become just a device vendor passing along or perhaps selling the data stream to all the interested parties who want your weight.",N/A,-1,-1
And that reluctance to let go of the individual app stems from a very real issue   namely we have no revenue models in place for these services so far.,N/A,-1,-1
I ve suggested that people could pay for real-time access to web services.,N/A,-1,-1
"For example, there s a 15-minute delay in sports scores resulting in a light change, something I might pay to get immediately.",N/A,-1,-1
"But then that revenue stream might have to be split between ESPN, which is providing the scores, the middleman IFTTT or Yo app and the light-bulb maker.",N/A,-1,-1
"Or perhaps the middlemen will sell ads of some sort, either by recommending recipes that use one service over another based on payments (an analogy might be paying for premium shelf space in a grocery store, or placing a sponsored ad on a search page) or something a bit more banal inside the service itself.",N/A,-1,-1
But many of these services see their value in becoming connective tissue of a sorts between the web and the real world.,N/A,-1,-1
The question is whether there s any money in that and if the eventual path to revenue alienates the users it purports to serve.,N/A,-1,-1
"If, as my friend Om Malik says, we re in the attention economy, these companies are trying to make a play in letting users control when and where they let their attention focus.",N/A,-1,-1
"That s a valuable place to be, so now the challenge is building out methods to get mainstream adoption and then trying to monetize those users or the partners.",N/A,-1,-1

Rackspace president Taylor Rhodes (pictured above) said the market is wising up to the difference between base infrastructure providers and providers who manage and support that infrastructure as well as the stuff customers run on it.,Taylor,2,2
"Companies are moving out of the notion of, geez, I should do all of that myself and moving into the notion of, geez, I want to go to somebody who does that for a living, who has expertise at scale to manage those for us,  Rhodes noted.",N/A,-1,-1
"There is a very different market between what AWS and Google are selling, which is unmanaged cloud, and what we are selling, which is managed cloud.",N/A,-1,-1

"So you want to launch a mobile app  Well, you re not alone.",N/A,-1,-1
"But the process is easier said than done, and you shouldn t hit the ground running without some careful preparation.",N/A,-1,-1
"If you want to get it right and successfully monetize your app, there are some key steps you can take to achieve your desired results.",N/A,-1,-1
The most effective of these is a soft launch.,N/A,-1,-1
A soft launch allows you to isolate success factors and problem areas in your app through a controlled release in a test market.,N/A,-1,-1
"In fact, independent research shows that about three quarters of game publishers use a soft launch before launching new titles, and the technique works for other types of apps, too.",N/A,-1,-1
"If you bypass this step and release your app to a broad market without any testing, you risk jeopardizing your desired results.",N/A,-1,-1
The basic idea of a soft launch is to release your app in a test market with similar characteristics to your target audience.,N/A,-1,-1
"For apps launching in the US, this usually means testing your app in English-speaking countries like Canada or Australia.",English,14,14
"For apps launching in the US, this usually means testing your app in English-speaking countries like Canada or Australia.",Canada,17,17
But don t just dive right in.,N/A,-1,-1
A soft launch isn t valuable unless you first consider what you re trying to measure.,N/A,-1,-1
A common question is: Does your game or app monetize  I ve observed that the answer to that question is too often initially  no.,N/A,-1,-1
"Better to learn that lesson during a soft launch, where you can go back to the drawing board to tweak your monetization strategy, than during a much broader and more costly release.",N/A,-1,-1
"In addition to monetization, soft launches are great for measuring other engagement metrics like user experience, user retention and virality.",N/A,-1,-1
"Just make sure you understand exactly what you re trying to test, because you can t test everything.",N/A,-1,-1
"Of course, in order to gain any valuable insights, you ll need to make sure you track both user acquisition (UA) and user experience (UX).",N/A,-1,-1
"The key to making a soft launch worthwhile, though, is tying this data to changes that have a significant positive impact on your app.",N/A,-1,-1
"For example, in one instance, a client found that users weren t completing their game s tutorial, which originally was almost five minutes long.",N/A,-1,-1
"After shortening the video to under a minute, their completion rate skyrocketed from 10 percent to 75 percent.",N/A,-1,-1
"In another instance, a client saw a 28 percent increase in returning users in its US launch compared with initial results from its soft launch, thanks to changes to their UI and gameplay experience.",N/A,-1,-1
Not to be overlooked are seemingly small things like your landing page and app icon.,N/A,-1,-1
"Your app store presence has a lot to do with your success, as this is the first impression users get after clicking an ad, and a soft launch is a great time to figure out if you need to make changes.",N/A,-1,-1
"I ve seen plenty of cases where tweaks to landing pages and icons, following a soft launch, have resulted in increased downloads for an app.",N/A,-1,-1
"In my experience, clients typically spend about one-fifth as much budget on a soft launch as they do on their full launch.",N/A,-1,-1
"Think about it: if you could spend $20K to learn the same critical lessons as you could learn spending $100K, which option would you choose 

In addition to seeing many great lessons learned during a soft launch, I ve also observed instances where issues during a major release could have been avoided had there been a soft launch.",N/A,-1,-1
"With a relatively low price tag and time commitment (typically about two to four weeks), it s hard to argue against the improved results a soft launch can generate.",N/A,-1,-1
"There are three main technology choices to consider when building apps for smart devices; web, native, and hybrid.",N/A,-1,-1
Web apps are built and deployed to a web server running in a data center and viewable through any device s web browser.,N/A,-1,-1
Native apps are built specific to a device s platform and are downloaded and installed onto the device through an app store.,N/A,-1,-1
Hybrid apps are built using similar web-based technologies as web apps but are bundled up and deployed inside native app wrappers that are distributed to users through app stores just like native apps.,N/A,-1,-1
Choosing which of the three different types of mobile apps to build involves prioritizing three potentially conflicting sets of goals.,N/A,-1,-1
"Those goals are time to market, total cost of ownership and the user experience.",N/A,-1,-1
"Time to market can include the total time it takes to develop an app for multiple platforms, or just one platform.",N/A,-1,-1
Total cost of ownership includes all development and support costs incurred over the lifetime of the app.,N/A,-1,-1
"The user experience is a little more difficult to measure as it deals with aspects of the app, like performance, responsiveness, ease of use, and overall appeal.",N/A,-1,-1
These experience-based aspects of an app can be a more subjective measure of an app s quality rather than an objective one.,N/A,-1,-1
"The problem is that these three very different goals can be influenced by factors that are not directly related to what technically distinguishes the web, native and hybrid technologies themselves.",N/A,-1,-1
These outside influencers can directly impact how an enterprise prioritizes each goal.,N/A,-1,-1
Most enterprise architectures are distributed across multiple tiers.,N/A,-1,-1
"Each tier is typically hosted on a different network that the other tiers have controlled access to, as they are protected behind firewalls to better protect and secure corporate data.",N/A,-1,-1
"For instance, there most likely will be a web tier, a services or business tier and a data tier.",N/A,-1,-1
These tiers have evolved over the years to accommodate an almost twenty-year boom in desktop-based web development.,N/A,-1,-1
"While this web tier can directly access the services tier in order to get to the information it needs, the same is not always true for native or hybrid apps running on smart devices disbursed across the internet.",N/A,-1,-1
Most enterprises have a roadmap in place outlining which of their services will be accessible over the internet and which ones will not be ready.,N/A,-1,-1
The services are accessible can become the primary reason that a purely web-based development strategy is adopted over a native or hybrid app.,N/A,-1,-1
"The existence of these services can certainly affect time to market decision when services do not exist, while on the other hand will drive up the total cost of ownership when they do.",N/A,-1,-1
"When it comes to evaluating the total cost of an app, targeting multiple platforms can at first be seen as a cost multiplier.",N/A,-1,-1
"If a change or enhancement needs to be made to the app on one platform, it needs to be made across all platforms.",N/A,-1,-1
"Efforts to eliminate this multiplier have created Mobile Application Development Platforms (or MADPs), like Adobe s PhoneGap, Apache s Cordova, Appcelerator s Titanium and Kony, that promise to deliver an app to multiple platforms from one code base.",Cordova,23,23

"Efforts to eliminate this multiplier have created Mobile Application Development Platforms (or MADPs), like Adobe s PhoneGap, Apache s Cordova, Appcelerator s Titanium and Kony, that promise to deliver an app to multiple platforms from one code base.",Apache,21,21
"While this can have some effect on the total cost of owning a mobile app, it will not eliminate all of the costs associated with supporting multiple platforms.",N/A,-1,-1
One challenge that enterprises face when choosing a development strategy that addresses more than one smart device platform is testing.,N/A,-1,-1
"Buying multiple test devices and developing a test strategy that includes an acceptable mix of platform versions, screen sizes and device capabilities is something that must be done regardless of how one decides to get an app onto a device.",N/A,-1,-1
"There are even occasions when testing efforts can benefit from having two identical test devices to compare how two different versions of the app behave, or how the same version of the app behaves on two different versions of the platform s OS.",N/A,-1,-1
There are places you can go that will allow you to test on a variety of different devices without having to actually purchase multiple devices.,N/A,-1,-1
One such place is OpenDeviceLab.,N/A,-1,-1
OpenDeviceLab is a grass-roots community movement that is helping create a community pool of test devices that developers can use.,N/A,-1,-1
Services like TestFlightApp and HockeyApp can make managing the distribution of test builds a much easier task as well.,N/A,-1,-1
"However, the costs associated with managing a battery of test devices is only one part of the total cost equation, albeit a very visible one.",N/A,-1,-1
There is still the matter of spending time executing the tests.,N/A,-1,-1
Currently the smart device market in the U.S. is dominated by two platforms.,N/A,-1,-1
"While the current market share and usage data point to adopting a development strategy targeting at least two mobile platforms, does it make sense to increase one s total cost of ownership by adding a third 

A new discipline among web designers and developers alike is what is known as responsive web.",N/A,-1,-1
The goal of responsive web is to design websites in such a manner that they adjust themselves to fit appropriately on different size screens.,N/A,-1,-1
This strategy lends itself well to repurposing existing web developers and designers as responsive web developers and designers.,N/A,-1,-1
At least that is the theory.,N/A,-1,-1
"When it comes to repurposing desktop web developers as mobile web developers, it is true that some of the core technologies used in each type of development have similar structures to them, like HTML, JavaScript and CSS.",N/A,-1,-1
"But in practice, the libraries and techniques that are used to implement a touch-friendly web design can come with an unexpected learning curve.",N/A,-1,-1
"Switching from a barebones JavaScript development discipline to more of an AngularJS based JavaScript framework like those used with Ionic or OnsenUI, two popular touch-based JavaScript frameworks, can take some getting use to.",N/A,-1,-1
"Perhaps not quite as steep of a learning curve as transitioning from Javascript to Objective-C, but a learning curve none the less.",N/A,-1,-1
"For both mobile web and hybrid development using tools such as Apache s Cordova, the setup and configuration of a mobile developer s work environment alone can be a daunting task for a traditional desktop web developer.",Cordova,13,13

Fortunately there are technologies like Genymotion that have stepped in and improved performance considerably.,N/A,-1,-1
"Ensuring that you have the right talent to craft a positive mobile experience can certainly increase costs up front, but expecting a veteran developer that has spent years perfecting your online desktop experience to instantly transition over to becoming your star mobile developer may not be as instantaneous of a process as one would like.",N/A,-1,-1

"Amazon Web Services has been the biggest and best cloud computing platform for years, and many would argue it still is.",N/A,-1,-1
But competition is picking up   led primarily by Google and Microsoft   leading some to question whether AWS s old habits will end up helping or hindering the business.,N/A,-1,-1
"One of the critics is Brad Feld, Foundry Group managing partner and TechStars co-founder, who recently explained the situation via metaphor: It s in a scorpion s nature to sting even when that s not in its best interests.",N/A,-1,-1
Feld came on the Structure Show this week to flesh out that metaphor and explain the infrastructure trends he s seen among his firm s portfolio companies.,N/A,-1,-1
It s definitely worth listening to the whole thing for more insights on the economics of computing in the cloud and the challenges startups face when dealing with large companies as customers or partners.,N/A,-1,-1
"But here are some highlights, explaining three areas where Feld thinks AWS and all cloud providers could stand to improve if they want to continue being the fan-favorite choices for IT infrastructure.",N/A,-1,-1
"[A]s the scale continues to increase for a traditional service   your operational excellence as a web service, or whatever you re doing as a business around that infrastructure, starts to become an important characteristic of your business,  Feld explained.",N/A,-1,-1
"And depending on on Amazon, or AWS,  for that, you don t get the cost savings that you think you re getting because you still have to have the people to manage that.",N/A,-1,-1
The argument that you don t need the people goes away at some point.,N/A,-1,-1
"Historically, he said, some companies tired of their AWS bills and experience used to test out SoftLayer, Rackspace or other options where they could still be in the cloud but also have more control over their resources.",N/A,-1,-1
"Increasingly, though, they re just installing their own gear in colo data centers and seeing impressive results:

However, Feld noted, pricing is one area where one element of Amazon s nature   to be the lowest-cost provider   is a benefit.",N/A,-1,-1
"That is, if AWS can keep Google from disrupting AWS s economics too much, too quickly, like it did to Microsoft not so long ago.",N/A,-1,-1
"It s a very powerful position to be in to be able to say,  We re just gonna change the pricing game,'  he said.",N/A,-1,-1
"If you roll back 15 years, Microsoft effectively went to subscription pricing with Office   and then all of a sudden today, it s like  Why am I paying for this stuff  

Feld acknowledged that AWS support has gotten better over the years, but that the improvement has come at a price, in terms of a percentage of the customer   total AWS bill, that many startups think is too high.",N/A,-1,-1
"If growing companies think they re paying top dollar for support, they d better feel they re getting top-level service:

 The challenge is when it fails and   AWS might be just fine, but as a customer, something s wrong with my instantiation on it somewhere, and it s segmented from me, so it s a black box, and the service people are working on it, but they get to it and there s latency.",N/A,-1,-1
"That s really bad   When you have 140,000 paying customers and you have a problem like that that is really abstracted away from you too far, and you re paying what you think is premium for support, and there s latency on it, that s tough.",N/A,-1,-1
"That doesn t have to happen very often for a company to start to say,  This isn t working for me.",N/A,-1,-1
Startup executives really get talking about exploring alternatives when they have to pay for credits or some sort of recompense after an outage happens.,N/A,-1,-1
"Feld said that has happened  in less than 10, greater than 1 of the 70 companies we re invested in.",N/A,-1,-1
"As these sorts of complaints add up, Feld said, a company s reputation starts to suffer.",N/A,-1,-1
"All of a sudden, the company that blazed the trail for so many others, and actually generated emotional responses from users, becomes just another IT vendor users have to deal with:

 Interestingly, some of those companies when they get to that scale, are now pushing harder on Amazon.",N/A,-1,-1
"They re paying the premium support fees, they re saying  We really, really, really don t want to do this.",N/A,-1,-1
"There s a sort of inflection point for some of those companies where they justify what s going on and hang in there, but they re not delighted customers anymore, they re not the ones screaming from the top of their lungs the praises of AWS.",N/A,-1,-1
They re kind of the customers that you kind of don t want.,N/A,-1,-1
"They re the ones that are stuck with you, but they re not that happy.",N/A,-1,-1
"Larger companies and their small-company partners can also fall prey to the trap of cannibalizing partner ecosystems   something of which AWS has been accused and which Feld, who was involved as an early Microsoft partner in the early  90s, knows all too well.",N/A,-1,-1
"Maybe it s because of customer demand or maybe it s just greed, but large companies undercutting their smaller partners with cheaper, inferior products is not a good look.",N/A,-1,-1
"[O]ver time, the startups start saying to each other,  Hey, you should be careful, because we had that corp dev conversation with Amazon, and here s how it went,'  Feld began.",N/A,-1,-1
"And two months later they came out with a competitive product that was inferior and stuff like that, but it didn t feel very good to us to go spend a whole bunch of time with them and tell them everything we re doing under the guise of maybe a deeper partnership, and then watch them come out with something that competes with us.",N/A,-1,-1

But the exam doesn t test for conversational skills: I never had to converse with someone or write an English sentence of my own.,English,20,20
"The test took 18 minutes, which is a lot shorter than nearly every standardized test I ve ever encountered.",N/A,-1,-1
"The reason the test might be short is because it uses a method called computerized adaptive testing, which uses answers to previous questions to tailor future questions.",N/A,-1,-1
"If you ve aced previous answers, you ll get harder questions in the future.",N/A,-1,-1
This means two people taking the same adaptive tests could receive wildly different exams.,N/A,-1,-1
"Adaptive testing isn t new, nor is it controversial.",N/A,-1,-1
"In fact, the TOEFL is computer adaptive.",N/A,-1,-1
"But most adaptive tests include dummy questions that don t count towards the score, which lengthens the exam.",N/A,-1,-1
The reason that these tests have questions that don t count is because it s impossible to calculate a final score on an adaptive test when there s no previous data on which questions are easy or difficult.,N/A,-1,-1
"One reason Duolingo can keep its Test Center tests short is because it can collect that kind of data from its main app, which offers many of the same questions in the context of a game.",Center,7,7
"But there have been tests given using adaptive methods and smartphones before, such as Testive s SAT diagnostic exam or Blackboard s mobile app.",N/A,-1,-1
The difference between Duolingo and those apps is that Duolingo wants to create a new credential: it wants a passing Test Center grade to be good enough for students applying for college and workers looking for jobs.,Center,22,22
"In order to do that, it will need to convince those institutions of two things: one, the test is not prone to cheating, and two, the that the test actually does measure whether someone can speak English.",English,41,41
In order to combat cheating   which can be pervasive in some regions   Duolingo is having a proctor review all Test Center exams.,Center,20,20
It is outsourcing that service to a proctoring company (it wouldn t tell me which one) which reviews the test after it is completed.,N/A,-1,-1
The proctors look for what they call  infringements  and classify them into two categories.,N/A,-1,-1
"A major infringement, like, say, having someone off-screen tell you an answer, is an automatic disqualification.",N/A,-1,-1
"The punishment for minor infringements, such as going off camera for a minute, or taking the test  not in a private quiet place,  isn t as severe, but when five of them add up the test is invalidated.",N/A,-1,-1
"People get an email letting them know they are disqualified and they can see this status on the actual app,  Gotthilf said.",N/A,-1,-1
"They can then retake the test, if they want, after 24 hours.",N/A,-1,-1
"The second issue, whether Test Center actually measures English fluency, is trickier.",Center,6,6
"The second issue, whether Test Center actually measures English fluency, is trickier.",English,9,9
The approach Duolingo is taking is it s trying to prove its test is well correlated with the exact exam it is trying to dislodge: the TOEFL.,N/A,-1,-1
"That s going to be easier said than done, because it s going to require a good number of students to take both exams in order to have large enough data sets to convince university administrators.",N/A,-1,-1
There is one validity and reliability study done by a professor at the University of Pittsburgh.,Pittsburgh,15,15
There is one validity and reliability study done by a professor at the University of Pittsburgh.,University,13,13
"While it s not peer-reviewed and it was sponsored by Duolingo, its methodology seems acceptable.",N/A,-1,-1
"The study looked at, primarily, Chinese speakers, Spanish speakers, and Portuguese speakers.",N/A,-1,-1
(Brazil is currently Duolingo s biggest market.,Brazil,1,1
) The subjects were overwhelmingly college students   nearly 72 percent   and about 40 percent had studied in the United States.,N/A,-1,-1
"As a group, the average amount of time spent studying English was about 11.25 years.",English,11,11
My one major issue with the study is that it only sampled the type of students expected to pass the TOEFL.,N/A,-1,-1
"What the study found is that the TOEFL scores and Test Center scores are correlated, but it s not perfect.",Center,11,11
"That makes sense   if you were to take the same test twice, it s unlikely you d get the same score both times.",N/A,-1,-1
Another important thing to check is whether the students get the same score on the test if they took it multiple times.,N/A,-1,-1
"According to the study, same-person scores are largely correlated, although at a slightly lower rate than most other mainstream non-adaptive tests.",N/A,-1,-1
"But the issue with Duolingo creating its own credential is that it s a for-profit, venture-backed startup, not a nonprofit like ETS, which administers the TOEFL.",N/A,-1,-1
"Part of the startup mentality is to provide rapid updates, which could mean that one version of the Test Center test might be slightly different than another in a way that calls the validity of the score into question.",Center,20,20
"For instance, Duolingo decided to break out the Test Center into a separate app, like lots of app companies are doing.",Center,10,10
"But when Facebook decides to separate Messenger from its main app, it s not like there are schools and corporations   million dollar institutions   counting on the service to work the exact same way is has in the past.",N/A,-1,-1
"Of course, it s not like the TOEFL is unchanging either; it gets updated once a year.",N/A,-1,-1
"In addition, there are issues with the devices themselves.",N/A,-1,-1
"For instance, my Android keyboard autocompleted words when I was transcribing during the exam.",N/A,-1,-1
A well-trained keyboard could end up doing the majority of a lot of spelling for some test-takers.,N/A,-1,-1
"But, Gotthilf said, this isn t too different from taking a proctored exam:  Some people have to take tests in noisy environments, on crappy keyboards, in severe heat.",N/A,-1,-1
"However, what matters at the end of the day is that there is a high correlation between the tests in terms of the final scores.",N/A,-1,-1
"In order to combat these discrepancies, Duolingo will date every exam.",N/A,-1,-1
"Also, unlike the TOEFL, there won t be an expiration date, so each institution needs to figure out what tests it will accept, if any.",N/A,-1,-1
"Duolingo plans to offer an option to send scores directly, which will obviate the need for an institution to verify a screenshot or email.",N/A,-1,-1
Duolingo also plans to offer a Spanish language certification by the end of September.,N/A,-1,-1
"As for my score  A day after I took the test, I got an email informing me I received a 10/10, which means I m an  expert  in the English language.",English,31,31
"That s a relief, because unlike the people the test is actually intended for, I don t have another language to fall back on.",N/A,-1,-1
"The fact that television viewing is changing dramatically   being disrupted by the web, by YouTube and other factors   isn t breaking news.",N/A,-1,-1

"That last piece of news really hit home for me, because it got me thinking again about how my own family consumes what used to be called television, and how much has changed in only a single generation.",N/A,-1,-1
I m old.,N/A,-1,-1
Let s get that out of the way right off the bat.,N/A,-1,-1
"I was born a few years before the moon landing, and I remember us all watching it as a family, my brothers and I lying on the carpet staring at the giant black-and-white TV set with the rotary knob for changing channels   something that we kids were required to do before the advent of remote controls.",N/A,-1,-1
"We had a total of about five channels then, as I recall (and we walked five miles to school every day, uphill both ways).",N/A,-1,-1
"Now there s a whole generation of cord-cutters, something my colleague Janko has written about extensively, and I have one daughter firmly in that camp: when she and her boyfriend got an apartment together, they chose to get high-speed internet and either download everything they want to watch or stream it via an Android set-top box.",N/A,-1,-1
"But my two youngest daughters   one teenager, one in her 20s   are even further down the curve: like the kids surveyed by Variety, names like PewDiePie and Smosh are more relevant to them than than most Hollywood actors.",Hollywood,39,39
"Neither of them actually admits to liking PewDiePie, a Swedish man who talks about video games and has 29 million subscribers.",N/A,-1,-1
"But they certainly know who he is, and are intimately familiar with his work.",N/A,-1,-1
"And they are unabashed fans of other YouTube creators and also of a growing group of Vine artists   whose work is in some ways more fascinating, because each clip is just seven seconds long.",N/A,-1,-1

"This method of consuming video has crossed over into other areas as well   so, for example, they both devoured the book The Fault In Our Stars and waited eagerly for the movie because they were already fans of author John Green, one-half of the group known as the Vlog Brothers, who got their start on YouTube and then branched out.",Green,42,42

Although we had major phone launches this spring there are likely more to come soon as sales for some companies are on the down-swing.,N/A,-1,-1
Samsung is a perfect example: Its sales growth has sputtered so it may need a product that breaks from the past.,N/A,-1,-1
"I m not sure if switching from a plastic to a metal case is much of a break, but it appears that s at least one strategy Samsung will soon take.",N/A,-1,-1
Images of the supposed mid-range Galaxy Alpha handset leaked out this week and line up with an FCC filing here in the U.S. Having the Galaxy name is a pretty strong indicator the phone will run Google Android and there are reports of a 4.7-inch 720p display on the phone.,N/A,-1,-1
"It s the sides that could win folks over though: After years of many complaints on the plastic parts found in the Galaxy S line, alleged pics of the Alpha show a metal side with chamfered edges.",N/A,-1,-1

The 14-inch display shows off Android in full-HD resolution and the laptop supports Beats Audio with four speakers.,N/A,-1,-1
"Most external battery packs charge through a USB cord, like the phones to which they provide backup power.",N/A,-1,-1
But USB cords have low max amperages   usually around 500mA   which means they top out at slow charging rate.,N/A,-1,-1
"Instead of charging a battery through your phone s charger, a smart new Kickstarter wants you to use the laptop charger you re lugging around anyway.",N/A,-1,-1
"The product is called ThinkPower, and it uses a Lenovo Thinkpad A/C adapter(sold separately) to charge a 10,00mAh battery in 90 minutes, if the Kickstarter s claims are to be believed.",N/A,-1,-1
"The $40 battery pack has two USB ports so you can charge any USB connected device, like an iPhone or even a Raspberry Pi.",N/A,-1,-1
"A laptop charger usually has an amperage rating of around 3.5A, which is several times what a USB cord maxes out at.",N/A,-1,-1
"It s a win-win situation: The battery can charge much quicker using the higher amperage, and you can carry one fewer cord around.",N/A,-1,-1
"Of course, as a Kickstarter, there are still several additional hurdles: It still needs thousands of dollars in funding.",N/A,-1,-1
"Plus, there s potential legal trouble.",N/A,-1,-1
"I m not sure if the ThinkPower is authorized to use the Lenovo A/C connector   Apple has sued companies in the past for copying its MagSafe   and even if it is, the  Think  might be infringing on a few trademarks.",N/A,-1,-1
So Lenovo could prematurely end this product s development if it wanted to.,N/A,-1,-1

"This time however, the stock market shift appears a little more solid.",N/A,-1,-1
"This Friday, August 8th, the stock market closed for the week with Facebook still holding a bigger market cap at $190 billion compared to IBM at $186 billion.",N/A,-1,-1
"It s an impressive shift, given that Facebook is a much smaller company by other metrics.",N/A,-1,-1
"It has 7,185 employees to IBM s 431,212, $7.87 billion in 2013 revenue (with 55 percent year on year growth) compared to IBM s $99.7 billion, and ten years of existence to IBM s 97.",N/A,-1,-1
"Two years ago, it would have been unthinkable that Facebook could pass the likes of IBM.",N/A,-1,-1
"But as the social media monster has grown bigger and advertising revenue has moved online, it s become a substantial player in the U.S. economy.",N/A,-1,-1
"After its second quarter earnings call, its market cap passed the likes of Disney, Coca Cola, and Intel.",N/A,-1,-1
Next target  Perhaps Microsoft and its Friday closing market cap of $356B.,N/A,-1,-1

"Koh wrote that on the basis of that earlier settlement (which offered $20 million to a much smaller pool of workers, who amounted to 5 percent of total defendants), the new settlement should be at least $380 million:

Koh also noted repeatedly that she was  disturbed  because the new proposed settlement offered workers a lower amount even though they were in a stronger legal position based on recent court rulings.",N/A,-1,-1
"[The] procedural posture of the case swung dramatically in Plaintiffs  favor after the initial settlements were reached,  Koh wrote.",N/A,-1,-1
"As a result of the settlement, which provides up to 25 percent for the workers  lawyers, the parties will have to either propose a new figure, or else take their chances at trial.",N/A,-1,-1
"The news of the initial settlement was leaked to the media in April, leading one of the engineers who was a lead plaintiff in the original case to object to the deal.",N/A,-1,-1
This week s ruling also offers details of a sweeping conspiracy in which the big tech companies entered secret pacts to refrain from recruiting each other s employees.,N/A,-1,-1

At the Black Hat security conference this week, a pair of professional penetration testers, Rob Ragan and Oscar Salazar of Bishop Fox, showed how they built a functional 1,000-node botnet by stringing together resources from a variety of services.",Bishop,28,28
They used it to mine some Litecoin and could have done a whole lot more if they weren t trying to minimize harm to other cloud users (by being noisy neighbors) or cloud providers (by driving up power bills).,N/A,-1,-1
"At its peak, the pair s bot was generating $0.25 in Litecoin per day per node.",N/A,-1,-1
"Spread across only 1,000 machines, that s $250 a day in free money.",N/A,-1,-1
"They could have performed click fraud, scanned networks for vulnerabilities or perpetrated DDoS attacks.",N/A,-1,-1
"Really, they could have done pretty much anything that didn t require higher-performance computing, such as mining Bitcoin or cracking passwords.",N/A,-1,-1
"For true hackers, Ragan noted, the best part is the process is very difficult to trace:  There s no trace of any attack tools or scripts on any attackers computer anywhere.",N/A,-1,-1
"The process Ragan and Salazar used was clever, but also rather simple.",N/A,-1,-1
"They scraped the local usernames (i.e., the part before the @ symbol) from a bunch of real email addresses on Pastebin, gathered some donated domain names from a site called freedns.afraid.org, and then set up some subdomains and MX records.",N/A,-1,-1
"Stocked with an endless supply of seemingly legitimate email addresses (gotta fool those spam filters) tied to quasi-functional email servers, they began signing up for services.",N/A,-1,-1
Those verification emails so many websites use to verify that people signing up for services are who they say they are   or at least aren t bots   were forwarded to a free Google App Engine app.,N/A,-1,-1
Ragan and Salazar set up that service s inbound mail-handling feature to automatically open the links in verification messages.,N/A,-1,-1
"Accounts validated, the researchers set up a method for controlling them all using SSH tunneling.",N/A,-1,-1
"If a service caught on that something wasn t right and restricted access, or if a trial expired, the pair would just  armadillo up,  as Ragan put it   rolling up their code and taking it to another service.",N/A,-1,-1
"They didn t list all the services they used, but they certainly got compute power from Google and presumably elsewhere, and they used various MongoDB services to store all their phony account information.",N/A,-1,-1
"They were able to get 16 gigabytes of free storage on Dropbox by referring a bunch of  friends,  and, again referring fake friends, pushed free storage on another unnamed service up to 1 terabyte before stopping.",N/A,-1,-1
"Ironically, Ragan noted, that service didn t even offer a terabyte worth of storage in its paid offering and, what s more, it s not clear there was a limit to how much they could have added as they kept referring more  users.",N/A,-1,-1
"The lesson learned from all this, Ragan went on to explain, is that cloud service providers need to get past the antiquated notion that one email address equals one user.",N/A,-1,-1
"If all they re doing to prevent fraud is sending email verifications, they re going to lose to hackers, spammers and other bad actors every time.",N/A,-1,-1
The pair popped up slides showing messages from numerous providers warning users they now require a credit card to sign up for free trials or canceling them altogether.,N/A,-1,-1
One virtual private server provider flat-out said it was shutting down due to botnet mining.,N/A,-1,-1
"Because most people trying to abuse services write programs to automate account signups, Ragan said things like CAPTCHAs, logic puzzles or other methods of fooling a bot really are effective, even if they annoy some real users.",N/A,-1,-1

"Rumors have mentioned the name  X+1  for months   it could just be a codename and not the phone s actual moniker   and a few benchmarks for what appears to be the X+1 have been published, says SlashGear.",N/A,-1,-1
Geekbench has some of these benchmark numbers for a tested handset dubbed the Motorola XT1097.,N/A,-1,-1
"According to Geekbench, the phone was running Android 4.4.4 on a Qualcomm MSM8974 chip at 2.46 GHz.",N/A,-1,-1
"Qualcomm used the MSM8974 designation for the older Snapdragon 800 in 2013, but its clock speed was capped at 2.36 GHz.",N/A,-1,-1
"That means the tested phone likely has a newer Snapdragon 801 chip, the same you ll find in the HTC One M8 or Samsung Galaxy S5.",N/A,-1,-1
"If correct, the Moto X successor should compare well in terms of performance this time around.",N/A,-1,-1
Motorola worked with Qualcomm to customize the Snapdragon S4 Pro system-on-a-chip for the Moto X last year; that s what allowed the phone to use a DSP chip for the  always listening  function that works with Google Now.,N/A,-1,-1
"There wouldn t be any need for Motorola to take the exact same approach this time around, however.",N/A,-1,-1
"The Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 natively has that functionality, because Qualcomm added it in the chip s predecessor.",N/A,-1,-1
"I suspect Motorola chose to customize an older Snapdragon for the original Moto X last year for two possible reasons: First, the Snapdragon 800 only became available in the second quarter of last year so processor inventory could have been low.",N/A,-1,-1
"Second, it s likely the company was able to put together a more power-efficient solution with the older chip.",N/A,-1,-1
"These reasons don t exist this year, however.",N/A,-1,-1
"Motorola s next flagship can continue to offer always listening functionality, reasonably long battery life and increased performance from a chip that s now readily available.",N/A,-1,-1
"If the benchmark data is correct, then, this year s Moto X+1 won t be looked upon the way the Moto X was   as an interesting phone with mid-range specifications.",N/A,-1,-1
"Instead, it would be a contender against the other flagships, particularly if the rumored 5.2-inch, 1080p display and 2 GB of memory   alluded to in the Geekbench data   are accurate specifications as well for the XT1097.",N/A,-1,-1

"Alan Lepofsky, VP and principal analyst with Constellation Research, said customer prospects fall into two camps.",N/A,-1,-1
"The first is companies looking looking for something new and are trying to avoid their existing stacks,  he said via email.",N/A,-1,-1
These customers typically evaluate startups like Jive or perhaps Tibco s Tibbr and then choose whichever offers the best integration with their other tools and intranet.,N/A,-1,-1
"Chatter and Yammer are also available independently, so a Microsoft shop could theoretically use Chatter, for example.",N/A,-1,-1
"The second camp is companies that realize social is no longer stand-alone category and so go to their existing vendor   IBM, Microsoft, SAP, Oracle, Infor or Salesforce.com   to use that vendor s product.",Oracle,26,26

The cycle   more like a roller coaster   of bitcoin price movements is becoming an interesting research topic for academics.,N/A,-1,-1
"However, how much of the price fluctuation has to do with the hype around the cryptocurrency 

Researchers at ETH Zurich, a university in Switzerland, decided to study how social information online affected the price in their paper  The digital traces of bubbles: feedback cycles between socio-economic signals in the bitcoin economy.",N/A,-1,-1
"The researchers looked at Facebook shares, number of tweets, number of downloads of the blockchain client, users on the network and the number of searches on both Google and Wikipedia to try to find a correlation between the price and the online network.",N/A,-1,-1
"As you can see above, there is a clear relationship between a spike of activity online and an upward swing in price.",N/A,-1,-1
"The paper found two positive feedback loops that affect bitcoin price:

However, just because people were searching for information about bitcoin doesn t mean the price would continue to soar.",N/A,-1,-1
"The researchers did find some negative aspects of search in relation to price:  3 of the 4 largest daily price drops were preceded by the 1st, 4th and 8th largest increases in Google search volume the day before.",N/A,-1,-1
"This behavior can be linked to the 21st century instinct to Google something as soon as it goes wrong,  In other words, user search activity responds faster to negative events, such as a security breach in a bitcoin exchange, than price.",N/A,-1,-1
"In this regard, search spikes are early indicators of price drops.",N/A,-1,-1
The study though doesn t take into account the events of 2014.,N/A,-1,-1

T-Mobile s runaway success provided daily evidence that consolidation wasn t necessary for smaller carriers to compete.,Mobile,1,1
"Maybe what Sprint needed wasn t scale, but rather an outspoken and aggressive CEO like John Legere to put it on the right path.",N/A,-1,-1
"To be considered a player requiring some regulatory assistance, [T-Mobile] has to probably get back to those levels of losing 300-400K subs every quarter,  Sharma told me.",Mobile,12,12
Another possibility is that Sprint s decline continues under new CEO Marcelo Claure and is lapped by T-Mobile (it s only 4 million subscribers shy of becoming the No.,Mobile,18,18

Facebook on Friday detailed how it uses a custom-made load balancing controller to distribute network traffic across its servers and save the company a whole lot in power consumption.,N/A,-1,-1
"The social networking giant found that when its web servers are idle and not taking user requests, they don t need that much compute to function, thus they only require a relatively low amount of power.",N/A,-1,-1
"As the servers handle more networking traffic, they need to use more CPU resources, which means they also need to consume more energy.",N/A,-1,-1
"Interestingly, Facebook found that during relatively quiet periods like midnight, while the servers consumed more energy than they would when left idle, the amount of wattage needed to keep them running was pretty close to what they need when processing a medium amount of traffic during busier hours.",N/A,-1,-1
This means that it s actually more efficient for Facebook to have its servers either inactive or running like they would during busier times; the servers just need to have network traffic streamed to them in such a way so that some can be left idle while the others are running at medium capacity.,N/A,-1,-1
"This is where the load balancing controller, dubbed Autoscale, comes into play.",N/A,-1,-1
"Autoscale acts as an intermediary between groupings of Facebook web servers and the company s in-house load balancers, which distribute the network traffic to the servers.",N/A,-1,-1
The controller makes sure the load balancers are constantly directing a medium amount of traffic to groups of web servers in order to make sure that the right amount of power is being used.,N/A,-1,-1
"During periods when there s not that much network traffic, Autoscale distributes the traffic to a smaller amount of servers   keeping them running at medium capacity   and leaves the rest of the servers either inactive or handling batch-processing tasks, both of which don t consume that much energy.",N/A,-1,-1
"Here s a technical breakdown of how Facebook gets Autoscale to do its trick, per the blog post detailing the system:

For this to work, we employ the classic control theory and PI controller to get the optimal control effect of fast reaction time, small overshoots, etc.",N/A,-1,-1
"To apply the control theory, we need to first model the relationship of key factors such as CPU utilization and request-per-second (RPS).",N/A,-1,-1
"To do this, we conduct experiments to understand how they correlate and then estimate the model based on experimental data.",N/A,-1,-1
Facebook claims that Autoscale makes its data centers much more energy efficient than the company s older method of having servers run at low capacity when there s little networking traffic.,N/A,-1,-1
"Using Autoscale on a particular cluster of servers, Facebook apparently saved 27 percent in energy consumption during midnight.",N/A,-1,-1
"The company said that on an average day, Autoscale can save 10 to 15 percent in energy for different servers.",N/A,-1,-1

"You re stuck with a hands-free conference call, for starters   so there s no privacy   and the call sound quality is less than optimal for both parties.",N/A,-1,-1
So it s a redundant experience that s actually worse than the experience the device is trying to replace or supplement.,N/A,-1,-1
"Don t expect to save money with a device such as this, either.",N/A,-1,-1

Sheet music may not exactly be what comes to mind when you think of technology changing the music world   but Los Angeles-based music startup Chromatik thinks that its app can be as disruptive to the hobby musicians as Spotify has been to the music fans of the world.,Los Angeles,20,21

"Chromatik offers users arrangements for the most popular instruments (and yes, your singing voice is one of them), and instantly transcribes titles when necessary.",N/A,-1,-1
The app also includes videos for most titles to give users a way to listen in on the original rendition or jam along with Pharrell Williams if they want to.,Williams,25,25
"There are a couple of other useful tools, including a metronome as well as the ability to annotate any title, but two features are worth singling out: Users can record audio or video of their practice sessions to review their progress, and then share highlights with the Chromatik community, or even with their friends on social networks, which adds a neat social take on the otherwise pretty solitary act of practicing music.",N/A,-1,-1
"The other feature will make anyone happy who has been playing music for a while: Users can also import existing sheet music titles by simply snapping pictures of each page, and then storing them in the cloud to be available through the app.",N/A,-1,-1
"I first met up with Chromatik s CEO Matt Sandler two and a half years ago in Los Angeles, when the company was still in the process of getting ready to launch its first app.",Los Angeles,17,18

"Demonstrated on a Motorola Moto X on Wednesday, the exploit affects almost any device using a modern Qualcomm Snapdragon chip.",N/A,-1,-1
"The flaw is in ARM s TrustZone technology, which basically allows a device to have two separate operating systems or  worlds,  one with privileged access, and one for normal apps and operation.",N/A,-1,-1
"By segregating access to hardware and sensitive information from the main OS, it s possible to improve device security.",N/A,-1,-1

"Developers can download the early take at Google s health platform and create apps for Android phones, Android Wear devices and the web, according to a Google blog post introducing the SDK on Thursday.",N/A,-1,-1
"Google says the SDK will give developers tools to access sensors and fitness data captured from those sensors:

 Google Fit provides a single set of APIs for apps and device manufacturers to store and access activity data from fitness apps and sensors on Android and other devices (like wearables, heart rate monitors or connected scales).",N/A,-1,-1
"This means that with the user s permission, you can get access to the user s fitness history   enabling you to provide more interesting features in your app like personalized coaching, better insights, fitness recommendations and more.",N/A,-1,-1
"There are three main APIs in the preview SDK to help developers create their apps: One for high-level access to sensors, one to record and upload fitness data and one to access historical fitness data.",N/A,-1,-1
"The Recording API leverages some of the smarts that will come with Android L, the next major release of Android.",N/A,-1,-1
"Instead of recording all data in real-time, Google says apps using this API can  register for battery-efficient, cloud-synced background collection of fitness data.",N/A,-1,-1
This ties in with an effort called Project Volta in Android L that will help extend battery life by managing data synchronization more efficiently.,N/A,-1,-1
"Does this mean that Google Fit will be tied specifically to the next version Android, leaving millions of phones running older software out in the cold  Not likely.",N/A,-1,-1
Google Fit is part of Google Play Services; a suite of functions that Google updates once every six weeks or so for phones running Android 2.3 or better.,N/A,-1,-1

Facebook said it will integrate PrivateCore s security smarts into its server stack.,N/A,-1,-1
"Facebook has been working to secure all network traffic that gets funneled around its data centers, and one way to do so is to use PrivateCore s vCage technology as a way to protect servers  from persistent malware, unauthorized physical access, and malicious hardware devices,  wrote Joe Sullivan, Facebook chief security officer.",Sullivan,51,51
"The idea behind the vCage technology is that in typical private or public clouds, thousands of compute nodes are scattered across multiple regions.",N/A,-1,-1
"If just one node were to be infected or tampered with, there s a chance that the entire cloud infrastructure could be compromised.",N/A,-1,-1

And it consumes the same amount of power as a hearing aid.,N/A,-1,-1
"I m holding in my hand a new machine for a new era,  Modha said in an interview.",N/A,-1,-1
When we started the SyNAPSE project many people thought it was impossible.,N/A,-1,-1
"As we look to the future, possible can become real.",N/A,-1,-1
This could open up a whole new frontier of scientific exploration and commercial exploitation.,N/A,-1,-1
"The chip, which appeared on the cover of the journal Science today, contains 1 million programmable neutrons and 256 million programmable synapses, and is capable of 46 billion synaptic operations per second per watt.",N/A,-1,-1
Neutrons represent computation while synapses take the place of integrated memory.,N/A,-1,-1
The SyNAPSE chip can also be scaled up   just attach more chips to each other and they become more powerful.,N/A,-1,-1
IBM achieved these feats by throwing out the old model for chip structure and acting more like a brain.,N/A,-1,-1
"As my colleague Stacey Higginbotham described an earlier SyNAPSE chip in 2011:

Today s chips run into a problem called the Von Neumann bottleneck, which is when the chip cannot feed the data in the memory to the processing core fast enough.",N/A,-1,-1
Without the data the chip idles and the incredible clock speeds we ve built into chips are somewhat wasted.,N/A,-1,-1
The neurosynaptic chip throws that model away and relies instead on tracking relationships between events and determining if those events lead to action.,N/A,-1,-1
"When the  neurons  on the chip fire, it sets of a binary response that the processors in each neuron evaluate.",N/A,-1,-1
"When enough feedback comes from that neuron or neurons nearby the system then  understands  where that information fits in, and the chip can make a decision to react to that series of stimuli.",N/A,-1,-1
"Fundamentally, this chip learns.",N/A,-1,-1
So IBM has an impressive chip on its hands.,N/A,-1,-1
But the real challenge will be getting people to use it.,N/A,-1,-1
"IBM has created a programming language and curriculum to aid the chip s adoption, but faces competition from other emerging designs.",N/A,-1,-1

"If the chip is adopted, Modha sees applications as diverse as cloud computing and wearable electronics.",N/A,-1,-1
Small devices like robots could roam long distances crunching large amounts of data without needing to recharge.,N/A,-1,-1
Autonomous cars and mobile devices could use the chip to see surroundings in real time.,N/A,-1,-1

How  By implementing technology called hydro-shearing.,N/A,-1,-1
"AltaRock can stimulate the well by injecting cold water into it, combined with particles of a material that can temporarily plug parts of the well and enable many more tiny cracks to form within the reservoir.",N/A,-1,-1
"AltaRock combines this tech with engineering work to make other parts of the plant more efficient, too.",N/A,-1,-1
"More cracks in a single well can make wells more productive, and it s much cheaper than developing a brand-new site, particularly an EGS site.",N/A,-1,-1
"Mandell says the cost of  repowering  a geothermal site using stimulations can be between $300,000 to $600,000 per well, or $23 per MWh for the levelized cost of electricity.",N/A,-1,-1
"Building a new geothermal site using traditional tech, meanwhile, can cost between $3 million and $8 million per well, or around $80 to $110 per MWh in the U.S. depending on the location, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.",Energy,45,45
"Bloomberg s Taylor notes that this cost is for competitive projects that have a good chance of getting built, but it can be much higher, too.",Taylor,2,2
"And for new EGS sites, the cost is even higher than that.",N/A,-1,-1
AltaRock s Petty said the company has attracted a lot of interest from owners of under performing geothermal sites.,N/A,-1,-1
"In addition, she said the stimulation technology can also help reduce the risk for companies that want to drill new geothermal wells.",N/A,-1,-1
"The biggest expense and hurdle for the geothermal industry is finding and drilling new wells, and the success rate of early exploratory well drilling can be as low as 50 percent (meaning that half the drilled wells don t meet expectations).",N/A,-1,-1

"Sprint and T-Mobile will plan for their futures as independent carriers, and that means they re almost certainly looking ahead to next year s broadcast spectrum incentive auction.",Mobile,3,3
The incentive auction will mark the FCC s first major release of new mobile airwaves since the 700 MHz auction in 2008 and the Advanced Wireless Services auction in 2006.,N/A,-1,-1
"Those bands became the foundation for the vast majority of the country s LTE networks, and likewise the auction results will shape carriers  mobile broadband plans for years to come.",N/A,-1,-1
The auction isn t without controversy since it will effectively transfer airwaves once reserved for broadcast TV to the commercial mobile industry.,N/A,-1,-1
"It s also not without complexity since the format involves a reverse auction in which broadcasters agree to sell off their spectrum, a repacking process in which the frequencies are grouped into licenses usable for mobile, and a forward auction in which the carriers actually bid.",N/A,-1,-1
"But if everything goes the FCC s way, a substantial amount of capacity will become available in major cities across the country.",N/A,-1,-1
T-Mobile and Sprint are particularly interested in this band because of where it s located on the electromagnetic spectrum: 600 MHz.,Mobile,1,1
"In the mobile world, those are low-band frequencies capable of spanning long distances and punching through walls.",N/A,-1,-1
They re ideal for building a network with greater coverage.,N/A,-1,-1
Coverage has always been a knock against T-Mobile and Sprint since their 4G networks don t venture far beyond metro areas.,Mobile,8,8
"And given they both own primarily mid-band and high-band spectrum, they re at a distinct disadvantage if they actually tried to build such far-reaching coverage footprints.",N/A,-1,-1
"T-Mobile has partially addressed the issue by buying some of Verizon s unwanted 700 MHz licenses, but those licenses only cover about half the country.",Mobile,1,1

"AT&T and Verizon have already started building two-tier LTE systems, initially using their 700 MHz spectrum as a kind of coverage blanket and then surgically implanting capacity in the cities with their higher-frequency bands.",N/A,-1,-1

"T-Mobile has already built a dense layer of capacity in big cities, and Sprint is starting to with its new Spark network.",Mobile,1,1
"If they want to compete head-to-head with Verizon and AT&T outside of the cities though, they need to fill the gaps in between.",N/A,-1,-1
Sprint and T-Mobile would have adopted a similar auction strategy if they merged   in fact they were looking into ways to coordinate their bidding   but they ll be forced to do so individually now.,Mobile,3,3
"Both, however, will have a sizable advantage when bidding in the auction.",N/A,-1,-1
The FCC recently proposed rules that will set aside blocks of 600 MHz airwaves for any carrier that isn t AT&T and Verizon.,N/A,-1,-1

Hong Kong plutocrat Albert Yeung Sau-shing doesn t like when the word  triad    which signifies organized crime   appears near his name as a search suggestion.,N/A,-1,-1
So he sued Google for libel.,N/A,-1,-1
"This week, Yeung succeeded as a Hong Kong court judge blessed his lawsuit, and declared that Google can be held responsible for the search suggestions, even though the service is completely automated.",N/A,-1,-1
"The decision, which cites recent pro-censorship rulings in Europe and Canada, is part of a trend that makes it easier for powerful people to remove unpleasant material from the internet.",Canada,11,11
"Albert Yeung Sau-shing is best known for his business empire that includes jewelry and entertainment companies, and he regularly appears on Forbes lists as one of Hong Kong s richest people.",N/A,-1,-1
"But according to news reports cited by Wikipedia, Yeung is also known for his role in various racketeering crimes.",N/A,-1,-1
"The public s interest in these criminal escapades likely explain why a search for Yeung s name in Google produces the third suggestion in the following list:

After Yeung discovered those results in 2012, he moved to sue Google for defamation and this week, in a 100-page decision (embedded below), Hong Kong judge Marlene Ng refused Google s request to throw out the lawsuit.",N/A,-1,-1
"According to Ng, Google can not claim immunity from libel by saying that the search suggestions are entirely automated.",N/A,-1,-1
"Instead, she found that Google faced the same obligations as a traditional publisher, and that Yeung can seek money for damage to his reputation.",N/A,-1,-1
"Ng s introduction to the decision explains that  googling  can make life easier but:

The judge s censorship solution, however, is troubling because Google s autocomplete tool is not libel in the normal sense of the world, but rather a reflection of what people are saying about a given subject   the subject in this case is Albert Yeung.",N/A,-1,-1
"And just like any public discussion, the things people say may be true, false or somewhere in between.",N/A,-1,-1
"See, for instance, what happens if you start typing a search for President Obama s music tastes:

The point is that by stifling search suggestions, Judge Ng s ruling may give prominent figures like Yeung a new tool to silence public opinion they disagree with.",N/A,-1,-1
"At the same time, the decision cites   and builds on   a worrying worldwide rush to censor Google.",N/A,-1,-1
"The Hong Kong ruling is not the first time Google has faced libel charges for its search suggestions: in Italy, for instance, a court last year ordered the company to filter results that produced  con man  and  fraud  besides someone s name.",Italy,20,20
"The Yeung decision is significant, however, because it comes at a time of growing concern over a controversial new  right to be forgotten  rule in Europe that lets people order Google to delete search results.",N/A,-1,-1
"Critics, including me, have warned that European decision could lead to new attacks on Google and free speech, and that the decision would do more to help the powerful hide their misdeeds than to protect the privacy of ordinary people.",N/A,-1,-1
"And, indeed, this appears to be exactly what s happening as figures like Yeung and former F-1 boss (and S&M orgy enthusiast) Max Mosley are now enjoying unprecedented success in remaking Google search results.",Max,28,28
"Perhaps worst of all, courts in countries with a strong tradition of civil liberties are helping to legitimize this new wave of censorship   and embolden strongmen in less free places to further crack down on access to online information.",N/A,-1,-1
"The Hong Kong decision, for instance, cites not only the European  right to be forgotten  court ruling, but also Google-related censorship orders in Australia and British Columbia.",Columbia,29,29
Such pro-censorship precedents are already helping courts in Hong Kong   where the rule of law is under threat from China   justify decisions like the one that sided with Yeung.,China,19,19

"As media companies and advertisers search for better ways of measuring the effectiveness of content, a lot of attention has been focused on what some like to call  engaged time.",N/A,-1,-1
"Designed by companies like Chartbeat, the publishing-analytics company, Upworthy   which recently open-sourced its  attention minutes  measurement   and the Financial Times, these metrics try to measure the time that a reader actually spends with a story instead of just tracking clicks.",N/A,-1,-1
But is engaged time a red herring  ProPublica president and former Wall Street Journal assistant publisher Dick Tofel thinks it might be.,Wall,11,11
"Tofel lays out his argument in an essay he wrote for the Media Impact Project, a venture launched by the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism that s trying to improve the theory and practice of media measurement.",Media,12,12
"In a nutshell, Tofel argues that while  engaged time  might be an improvement over blunt or fatally flawed instruments like raw pageviews or even unique visitors, it still suffers from some fairly major problems.",N/A,-1,-1
"For one thing, he says the simple fact that a person spends more time with a specific story doesn t necessarily mean that they are actually more engaged.",N/A,-1,-1
"It could mean that the story is just really long, or it s a video clip   and the longest stories aren t always the ones with the most impact.",N/A,-1,-1
"Tofel also argues that encouraging media companies to focus on engaged time or  attention minutes  could cause publishers to lengthen the content they are producing, in the same way that focusing on pageviews drove some media companies to spend all their time pumping out tiny chunks of viral clickbait.",N/A,-1,-1
"In other words, the metric itself could have unintended consequences:  Do we really want reporters and editors to undertake a constant effort to take up more of a reader s time, to always lengthen stories where feasible  to use more video simply because people may mindlessly watch

"Haile says he agrees with Tofel that measuring the actual impact of a specific story is difficult, but argues that the idea behind engaged time is somewhat different:

By implication, there are two main strategies publishers can follow, Haile says   they can either create great short-form content that gets people to return regularly, or they can create long-form stories that get readers to engage for a long time.",N/A,-1,-1
"The only people who suffer under this scenario, he says  are those who create content that no one reads and to which no one returns.",N/A,-1,-1
"Jonathan Stray says like Tofel, he is unconvinced that engaged time is the holy grail of reader measurement:  Journalism is very much a multi-stakeholder endeavor, so why should we imagine that a single number can capture all aspects of the activity   Daniel Mintz of Upworthy, meanwhile, says he agrees that engaged time isn t the ultimate barometer for media measurement, but argues that it is another tool that can be used in addition to all of the existing metrics in order to get a better handle on what readers are doing and why:

It s more than a little ironic that while publishing online provides an almost infinite ability to measure every twitch and click and eye movement of the reader, media companies and advertisers aren t really that much closer to figuring out how to tell whether what they are publishing is actually having any effect or not.",N/A,-1,-1

"Brandishing a pair of hedge clippers, Hesse s CTO Barry West sliced through the cable   a pretty obvious metaphor for cutting the internet cord.",Barry,10,10
"Just 10 months after taking over Sprint, Hesse was presiding over the launch of Sprint s new Wimax network and supposedly heralding the age of 4G.",N/A,-1,-1
"The even-mannered but outgoing CEO looked at ease at the staged event, but Wimax wasn t a technology that Hesse picked.",N/A,-1,-1

But that wasn t the only bad decision Hesse inherited.,N/A,-1,-1

Hesse was probably given one of the hardest jobs in the mobile industry when he moved over from Sprint s spun-off wireline business Embarq in 2007 to run Sprint proper.,N/A,-1,-1
"Two years earlier Sprint had acquired fellow nationwide mobile carrier Nextel, which triggered a wave of subscriber defections and financial troubles that would plague Sprint all the way up until 2013 when it finally shut down Nextel s old iDEN network.",N/A,-1,-1

"While Hesse carried the Nextel albatross for his entire tenure, it proved to be the lesser of the problems he inherited.",N/A,-1,-1
The decision that confounded Hesse throughout his tenure was Wimax.,N/A,-1,-1
Wimax was a mobile broadband technology heavily promoted by the Intel and other tech giants as an alternative to traditional cellular systems.,N/A,-1,-1
It was intended to put Sprint on the cutting edge of the mobile data revolution while its competitors waited for LTE to emerge from the standards-making process.,N/A,-1,-1
The problem was Sprint was in dire financial straits after the Nextel acquisition.,N/A,-1,-1
It couldn t afford to build the network.,N/A,-1,-1
"After launching Wimax in three cities, Hesse turned Sprint s 4G networks and its spectrum over to Clearwire, which had funding from a range of tech players including Google and Intel.",N/A,-1,-1
The move effectively put Sprint s mobile broadband future into the hands of a company Sprint didn t directly control.,N/A,-1,-1
"When Clearwire also started to suffer financially during last decade s recession, its network construction ground to halt with only a third of the U.S. population covered.",N/A,-1,-1
Verizon and AT&T accelerated their LTE deployments and quickly lapped Sprint in both 4G coverage and capacity.,N/A,-1,-1
"As support for the Wimax standard collapsed globally, Sprint was forced to swallow its pride and commit to LTE.",N/A,-1,-1
"But because of its entanglements with Clearwire, it couldn t just shut down the network and start over.",N/A,-1,-1
That led to a network situation that bordered on the absurd.,N/A,-1,-1
"For more than a year Sprint was maintaining service over four different network technologies   CDMA, LTE, Wimax and iDEN   spread out over three different frequency bands.",N/A,-1,-1

"The idea was to create a next-generation network infrastructure on which it could use any 2G, 3G or 4G radio technology.",N/A,-1,-1
"And last year, it launched the beginnings of Spark, its 4G network to end all 4G networks.",N/A,-1,-1

"You can t say Hesse s reign at Sprint has been a success, unless your measure for success is keeping Sprint out of bankruptcy and complete financial insolvency.",N/A,-1,-1
But I would argue that many of the problems Hesse was forced to contend with weren t of his own making.,N/A,-1,-1
The decisions Forsee and the Sprint board made in the years prior to Hesse taking had disastrous consequences.,N/A,-1,-1
Even the move to give up Sprint s 4G assets to Clearwire was set in motion before Hesse arrived at the helm.,N/A,-1,-1
"What s more, Hesse didn t get much support from its current owner, Masayoshi Son s SoftBank.",N/A,-1,-1

"But instead of buckling down to focus on preserving customers, innovating new service plans and building its long-delayed miracle network, Son immediately started looking toward the next acquisition.",N/A,-1,-1

"For those of you wondering why Uber broke the news of its new carpooling feature after 8 pm ET last night, we now have a potential answer.",N/A,-1,-1
It looks like Uber may have been trying to beat its pink mustachioed rival   Lyft   to the punch.,N/A,-1,-1
This morning Lyft announced its own version of carpooling: Lyft Line.,N/A,-1,-1
"Passengers going the same direction can request  Line  within the app, the same way they might request a regular Lyft or a Lyft Plus.",N/A,-1,-1
"The app will match people who are requesting pick up in the same neighborhood, and the Lyft driver will swing around to get everyone.",N/A,-1,-1
"Just like with Uber s proposed  UberPool,  this is likely to be a slower car ordering option than regular Lyft, but it will slash the costs.",N/A,-1,-1
"The app will automatically deduct a discount that s 10-60 percent less than the ride would normally be otherwise, so passengers don t need to haggle among themselves to figure out a fair split.",N/A,-1,-1
"Even if a match isn t made, passengers will still get a ride as requested, and will pay the fixed discounted price shown when they first requested the ride,  said a Lyft spokeswoman.",N/A,-1,-1
This will feel like an original Lyft ride at a more affordable price.,N/A,-1,-1
"UberPool will also offer customers a discount, regardless of whether they find a carpooling match.",N/A,-1,-1
The similarities between Lyft Line and UberPool are so striking that it s likely information was leaked between the two competitors.,N/A,-1,-1
"Uber may have been the first to make its new feature announcement, but Lyft is more prepared to actually roll it out.",N/A,-1,-1

"Italian site Mister Gadget got its hands on the Moto 360 dock, and based on the early images, the implementation looks much better than that of the Samsung Gear Live and LG G Watch.",N/A,-1,-1
The Moto 360 looks to fit on its dock in a way that shows the time like a desk clock.,N/A,-1,-1
It also shows the charge level as an almost circular meter around the watch s face; it s  almost  circular because a small portion of the Moto 360 s round display is used for the display digitizer connection.,N/A,-1,-1

"Back in the olden days, when companies had to buy lots of shrink-wrapped software, vendors used bundles of four or five or more applications   Microsoft Office or Back Office, Lotus SmartSuite   as well as volume discounts to sell a boatload of bits at a big discount.",N/A,-1,-1
"People bought, but they also ended up with rights to a lot more software than they needed (or ever used).",N/A,-1,-1
"A common sight in those days was stockpiles of actual boxes   shrink-wrap unbroken   in storerooms, bought and paid for, but unused.",N/A,-1,-1
"Later, when companies started deploying from servers, the piles may have disappeared, but the impact was the same: A lot of those software licenses lay fallow.",N/A,-1,-1
"This might have been good for the vendor initially, but it was a ticking time bomb.",N/A,-1,-1
Customers started to wonder just how great a deal they really got and (god forbid) to question the value of the software itself.,N/A,-1,-1
One of the supposed advantages of cloud computing over that on-premises deployment model was that you would only buy what you need and pay for what you use.,N/A,-1,-1
"But a funny thing happened en route to cloud: It turns out that customers still buy too much stuff   they  over-provision  or buy more cloud resources than they need and end up with shelfware, only in someone else s cloud.",N/A,-1,-1
"Given the low cost of many of these resources, you might say, big deal.",N/A,-1,-1
"But waste is waste and underutilized resources are a no-no from a security perspective, too.",N/A,-1,-1
Upfront Ventures general partner Mark Suster has an interesting take on the dangers of shelfware here.,N/A,-1,-1
There are a couple common scenarios that lead to shelfware in the cloud era.,N/A,-1,-1
"First, many companies often book and pay for long-term instances, which require the buyer to commit for a one- or three-year term to get a bigger discount.",N/A,-1,-1
"The problem is those instances often end up underused or even unused for a big chunk of that time, said the CTO of a San Francisco startup who did not want to be quoted.",San Francisco,25,26
"Second, in big companies many users are authorized to spin up cloud resources.",N/A,-1,-1
"They may use on-demand instances that carry no long-term commitment, but they don t clean up after themselves when the job is done.",N/A,-1,-1
They forget to turn off the resources and the meter s still running.,N/A,-1,-1
"And third, many businesses still don t understand that they need to structure their applications and deployments differently for the elasticity of cloud.",N/A,-1,-1
"They end up launching servers and letting them live forever like you would in a traditional data center, doing updates, managing user accounts, upgrading software, etc.,  the CTO said via email.",N/A,-1,-1
"Instead they should be leveraging autoscale, measuring their performance and adjusting capacity as needed.",N/A,-1,-1
[This is a] very common problem among enterprises moving to the cloud where their staff isn t yet adjusted.,N/A,-1,-1
"Sometime in the last few weeks, Microsoft turned off access to six- and 12- month discounts for Azure to new users without explanation.",N/A,-1,-1
"A long-time Microsoft partner surmised that the vendor s salespeople are supposed to encourage actual utilization, not revenue from shelfware and deals like this one tend to engender shelfware.",N/A,-1,-1
"My guess is Microsoft plans to offer something akin to Google s  sustained use discount,  unveiled in March.",N/A,-1,-1
That discount kicks in automatically when a compute instance is used for 25 percent of the time over a month (see chart below.,N/A,-1,-1
) That idea resonated with startups that are sick of juggling spreadsheets and checking dashboards to optimize their cloud spending.,N/A,-1,-1
"Still, given that Microsoft and (I think IBM as well) is including discounted cloud in enterprise licenses that include other software, the prospect for more shelfware sprawl could be growing.",N/A,-1,-1
The problem of shelfware is not lost on vendors.,N/A,-1,-1
"A raft of startups   Cloudyn, Cloudability, Newvem (now part of Datapipe), as well as Rightscale    all help customers pinpoint unused cloud capability.",N/A,-1,-1
Even the cloud providers themselves see overprovisioning as an issue.,N/A,-1,-1
"Amazon Web Services  Trusted Advisor, for example, also highlights underused resources for cost-optimization purposes.",N/A,-1,-1
Cloudyn co-founder Vittaly Tavor said the Amazon  goes to great lengths to say it s trying to save customers money by pointing out instances suspected to be idle and by pushing customers to purchase Reserved Instances as a way to save money.,N/A,-1,-1
"It s not being totally selfless here, he added, because by pushing Reserved Instances, it gets customers to commit to long term use.",N/A,-1,-1
"So generally, the bottom line is that customers have to be smart about what they deploy, no matter where they deploy it.",N/A,-1,-1
"Public cloud, in-house server room   all the same issue.",N/A,-1,-1
Tavor said the over-provisioning in cloud is  just a notch lower than in a traditional data center.,N/A,-1,-1
Gartner cloud analyst Lydia Leong agreed.,N/A,-1,-1
"The real problem tends to be customers over-provisioning, wasting capacity in the same way that they do on-premises.",N/A,-1,-1

As more than one supporter has noted, anonymous apps may encourage trollish behavior, but they can also have a positive side as well: in fact, some users have credited the service with helping them when they were suicidal or depressed, and some argue that they allow for better conversation around highly politicized events like the bombings in Gaza.",Alexis,2,2

"The post author, a University of Ghent (in Belgium) Ph.D. student named Sander Dieleman, explains that the goal of his research was to make it easier for new or obscure songs to get included among listeners  recommendations.",University,5,5
"Essentially, he wants to help listeners hear new songs by recommending others that sound like the songs they already like, instead of songs that other people with similar tastes also like.",N/A,-1,-1
Dieleman s project at Spotify expands on a paper he and fellow Ghent researchers published in December.,Ghent,12,12
The major problem with current recommendation systems is that they re largely based on a technique called collaborative filtering.,N/A,-1,-1
"According to Dieleman:

The idea of collaborative filtering is to determine the users  preferences from historical usage data.",N/A,-1,-1
"For example if two users listen to largely the same set of songs, their tastes are probably similar.",N/A,-1,-1
"Conversely, if two songs are listened to by the same group of users, they probably sound similar.",N/A,-1,-1
"Unfortunately, this also turns out to be their biggest flaw.",N/A,-1,-1
"Because of their reliance on usage data, popular items will be much easier to recommend than unpopular items, as there is more usage data available for them.",N/A,-1,-1
"Dieleman s deep learning system, which he explains in some detail in the post, analyzed thirty-second samples from about 500,000 of the million most popular songs on Spotify in order to learn their acoustic features.",N/A,-1,-1
He used the rest of the millon songs to test the system.,N/A,-1,-1
What s really cool about the blog post is that Dieleman includes sample playlists based on songs that activated certain of the 256 low-level filters in the neural network in different ways (e.g.,N/A,-1,-1
"bass drums, vocal thirds or chords).",N/A,-1,-1
"He also includes high-level-feature playlists (which combine results for all the low-level features and, in some cases, pretty much grouped songs by genre) and soundalike playlists for specific songs.",N/A,-1,-1
"Although his ultimate goal with this approach is to help listeners uncover new artists and songs by incorporating the results of the model into recommendation algorithms, Dieleman notes that it also has other uses.",N/A,-1,-1
"Those include filtering outliers (songs with little acoustic similarity, presumably) in existing recommendation algorithms, and filtering out intro and outro tracks and cover songs.",N/A,-1,-1
"It seems likely that other media properties, including Netflix, are also hoping to achieve similar things with their own recommendation engines using deep learning.",N/A,-1,-1
"There are a lot of latent features to media content beyond just what users have liked, what genre things fall into and what other people are watching.",N/A,-1,-1
