This week the Chairman of the FCC and Google both seemed to come out in favor of holding wireless internet to the same network neutrality standards we hold the wired internet.,N/A,,-1,-1
This has long been the goal of net neutrality advocates since back in 2010 when the FCC was writing the rules that would prevent last-mile broadband access providers from discriminating against traffic on their networks.,N/A,,-1,-1
"After Google caved on the wireless issue, in what looked to be a realization that its business interests were tied to Verizon and others thanks to the nascent Android operating system, the FCC backed off the effort to make sure wireless networks were held to the same standards.",N/A,,-1,-1
But the FCC and Google are apparently changing their minds.,N/A,,-1,-1
"In a speech before the CTIA Tuesday, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler made a veiled threat to the wireless industry, saying:

He didn t come out and say the FCC was going to rethink how it views wireless in the net neutrality debate, but he certainly hinted that it was an option.",Wheeler,0,11,11
And many in DC are heartened by Wheeler s comments.,Wheeler,0,7,7
"Wheeler is really from the Ben Bernanke school of signaling before you do something crazy,  said Harold Feld, a lawyer with consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge.",Harold,0,17,17
"Wheeler is really from the Ben Bernanke school of signaling before you do something crazy,  said Harold Feld, a lawyer with consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge.",Wheeler,0,0,0
He is signaling that he is looking to up the rules on net neutrality on wireless.,N/A,,-1,-1
Google apparently is too.,N/A,,-1,-1
Jon Brodkin over at Ars Technica noticed earlier this week that Google is apparently back on the table as supporting network neutrality for both wireless and wireline access.,N/A,,-1,-1
"That s a significant shift from its 2010 position, although Google didn t mention it in its most recent net neutrality filing from June 13.",N/A,,-1,-1
"However, several internet lobbying groups such as the Internet Association and several tech firms (including Google) back in May have also made statements about bringing wireless back into the network neutrality discussion.",N/A,,-1,-1
"So in light of Google s apparent volte-face and the Chairman s even more surprising almost-threat to the CTIA that the agency is looking at how network neutrality should play out on wireless networks, it s worth looking at what has changed since 2010

When the 2010 debate over network neutrality was raging, less than 30 percent percent of Americans had a smartphone, and they were using them very differently than they are using them now.",N/A,,-1,-1
"During 2010, people in the U.S consumed an average of 350 MB/mo of data per month compared to 2013, when shared data plans and more devices helped push data consumption to 1.2GB per month, according to Chetan Sharma, a wireless industry analyst.",N/A,,-1,-1
"Plus, as Sena Fitzmaurice, a spokeswoman for Comcast, pointed out, if more than 20 percent of visits to the internet are coming from mobile phones, a significant amount of eyeballs access the net via wireless networks, which means that any unfair deals would affect one in five attempts to get online.",N/A,,-1,-1
Comcast says it is in favor of both wireless and wireline network neutrality.,N/A,,-1,-1
"And then there are the people themselves, who are changing how politicians view the debate.",N/A,,-1,-1
"Thanks to John Oliver s rant, the average consumer is far more engaged in the network neutrality debate than they were in 2010, and has told the FCC and her Congressmen what she thinks.",Oliver,0,3,3
"Back in 2010 the carriers defended the need for wireless exceptions because wireless networks have far less capacity than wireline networks, and killing a carrier s ability to make special deals to guarantee high quality services would stop the development of things like remote medical monitoring.",N/A,,-1,-1
"Four years, later, carriers aren t really offering new services, which has the FCC and others wondering why they made this exception.",N/A,,-1,-1
"Plus, it appears that the FCC is even becoming skeptical of the congestion argument, as you can with with Wheeler s request to Verizon to justify the changes to its unlimited data plan.",Wheeler,0,21,21
"Well, ok, Rdio isn t actually dead.",N/A,,-1,-1
But deals like the one T-Mobile recently signed to exempt the data used by customers accessing Spotify and Pandora streams from any data charges illustrate exactly what the FCC was trying to prevent when it built network neutrality rules.,Mobile,0,6,6
"In this case, consumers may benefit, but a service that s smaller and not part of the deal certainly won t. AT&T s sponsored data plan is another example, where companies can pay to exempt their content from AT&T customer s data usage.",N/A,,-1,-1
Om called it an example of carriers seeking to charge both consumers and content providers and thought it reprehensible.,N/A,,-1,-1
The FCC may also see it as a problem.,N/A,,-1,-1
A favorite argument for people in favor of network neutrality is the success of Netflix.,N/A,,-1,-1
"Since ISPs also offer paid TV services, they had every interest in discriminating against Netflix traffic, thus making it harder for a startup to compete.",Since,0,0,0
"Now, as AT&T looks to acquire DirectTV and Verizon is consolidating a variety of online TV assets under the Redbox management, it s possible that mobile providers will have their own TV services.",N/A,,-1,-1
"Even Netflix is getting in on the mobile game, which means that the same battles that played out on wireline networks could soon play out against on wireless.",N/A,,-1,-1
"And finally there s the quesiton of Title II, the idea that instead of imposing network neutrality using a plan that basically guarantees paid prioritization on the internet the agency reclassifies broadband as a transportation service.",N/A,,-1,-1
"Title II has gained ground with consumers and tech companies in recent weeks, and it s gone from the seemingly nuclear option to something that has really influenced the debate.",N/A,,-1,-1
The carriers might be so afraid of Title II they will be willing to back down on wireless net neutrality as a way to placate the FCC and public.,N/A,,-1,-1
"In short, our increasing reliance on mobile internet, the carrier s fear of additional regulations and the FCC recognizing the harm that a bifurcated internet could cause, are all behind this resurgence of interest in making wireless networks just as neutral as wireline networks.",N/A,,-1,-1
Hopefully it won t mean that both networks get paid prioritization.,N/A,,-1,-1
"There has been a flurry of activity in the cloud computing space in the few months, and in the past couple weeks in particular.",N/A,,-1,-1
"Probably the biggest news, at least for people who ve been watching the space for years, is that HP bought private-cloud startup Eucalyptus and has made Eucalyptus s CEO, Marten Mickos (pictured above, at Structure 2012), the new vice president and general manager of HP Cloud.",N/A,,-1,-1
"This is a pretty major move in the world of cloud computing software, where Eucalyptus was one of a handful of options   along with VMware, CloudStack (open source and the Citrix-supported version) and myriad OpenStack distributions   that enterprises wanting private or hybrid cloud environments had to choose from.",N/A,,-1,-1
"There are some definite possible benefits of Mickos coming on board to try and transform HP s cloud strategy and technologies into something companies would want to buy, but there s also a not-to-clear plan in place about about will happen with the Eucalyptus technology.",N/A,,-1,-1
"We had Mickos, along with HP CTO and director of HP Labs director Martin Fink and HP Cloud Senior Vice President of Product and Service Management Bill Hilf, on the Structure Show podcast to discuss the deal and what it means.",Martin,0,14,14
"You can, and probably should, listen to the whole thing.",N/A,,-1,-1
But the HP-Eucalyptus deal was just one of a handful of big things that happened in the past couple weeks.,N/A,,-1,-1
"We also saw Microsoft thoroughly embrace an open source project from Google, Google hire away Red Hat s CTO to head up its cloud business, and Citrix realign its cloud strategy after seemingly the entire CloudStack team, including its GM and the technology s creator, left the company.",N/A,,-1,-1
"If I were a betting man, I still wouldn t bet on the private cloud approach really panning out, at least as it s currently being implemented.",N/A,,-1,-1
"Next-generation stuff like containers, Kubernetes and Mesos, and Cloud Foundry, seem like a better approach in terms of the operational experience, including going hybrid.",N/A,,-1,-1
They re already delivering results for the companies using them.,N/A,,-1,-1
"I also think Google is going to make life a lot more difficult for everyone   Amazon Web Services, but also traditional enterprise cloud providers   as it tries to prove it s a legitimate option for all types of workloads and customers.",N/A,,-1,-1
"However, as Barb Darrow and I discuss during the news segment of this week s podcast, the one company we haven t heard from lately is AWS, which is likely saving a cache of big news for its annual re:Invent conference in November.",N/A,,-1,-1
"It s in vogue right now to say Google has backed AWS into a corner, but we ll probably see how true that really is in a couple months.",N/A,,-1,-1
"If AWS can prove it s still an engine of innovation, including making its own push into the data center, then everyone will need to recalibrate their predictions once again.",N/A,,-1,-1
"There has always been a lot of confusion in the private-cloud space, especially around OpenStack, and now there s a bit of consolidation happening, too.",N/A,,-1,-1
"Companies like HP had better figure out a way to finally start selling their vision of cloud computing, or they re going to find there s no installed base to cling to when newer, shinier and arguably better options become ready for primetime.",N/A,,-1,-1
Google Chrome is a great browser made even better by options for customization.,N/A,,-1,-1
"What makes Chrome a really personal browser is the huge catalog of extensions that you can add to it, making your web experience even better.",N/A,,-1,-1
The Chrome Web Store features thousands of apps and extensions for the Chrome browser.,N/A,,-1,-1

Voila!,N/A,,-1,-1
"Though some sites don t work with this extension, it s still great to have an additional defense line between you and hackers.",N/A,,-1,-1
"If you want to go for a security overkill, consider using an alternative security-oriented browser, like WhiteHat Aviator, and add the above extensions.",N/A,,-1,-1

Pixel-perfect screen designs have been a trademark of native iOS development from day one.,N/A,,-1,-1
A tradition that with the introduction of new iPhone screen sizes may have to give way to adaptive screen design across the platform.,N/A,,-1,-1
Native iOS developers tend to cater to specific devices mores than mobile web and Android developers.,N/A,,-1,-1
"But when the number of variances in screen sizes gets out of control, all you can do is gravitate more towards an adaptive or responsive approach in your app s design.",N/A,,-1,-1
"Prior to the iPhone 6, there have been very few screen size differences to contend with in the iOS world compared to Android.",N/A,,-1,-1
"When looking at the screen dimensions for each of the different iPhone models supported by iOS 8, only the iPhone 4S supports a 3:2 aspect ratio.",N/A,,-1,-1
"The iPhone 5, 5C, 5S as well as the new iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus all support a 16:9 aspect ratio.",N/A,,-1,-1
"Moving from the iPhone 4 to the iPhone 5, Apple kept the pixel width of the different screens constant at 640.",N/A,,-1,-1
"It was the pixel height that changed from 960 to 1136, which transitioned the iPhone from a 3:2 ratio to 16:9.",N/A,,-1,-1
"With the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus, both the width and the height changed keeping the aspect ratio fixed at 16:9 across all iOS 8 supported iPhones, except the iPhone 4S.",N/A,,-1,-1
The shorter dimensions of the iPhone 4S compared to the other iOS 8 supported iPhones makes it more difficult to support when it comes to screen design.,N/A,,-1,-1
"Simply put, designs don t scale well when crossing over to a different aspect ratio.",N/A,,-1,-1
But this is not a new challenge for iOS developers to contend with; this has been a part of iOS 7 development all along.,N/A,,-1,-1
"As a result, there are still some iOS 6 apps out there that do not conform to the 16:9 screen dimensions of the iPhone 5 and center themselves on the screen, leaving blank black bars of dead space across the top and bottom of the device.",As,0,0,0
"The good news about the screen dimensions on both the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus is that all of the effort put into redesigning apps to take full advantage of the iPhone 5 screen size will, for the most part, scale nicely on both the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus.",N/A,,-1,-1
"Out of the gate, Apple has made every effort to keep apps that were specifically redesigned in iOS 7 for the iPhone 5, 5C and 5S to look as good as possible in iOS 8 on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.",N/A,,-1,-1
"The auto-scaling capabilities built into iOS will look better than the letter-boxing effect app owners had to deal with as developers redesigned their screens from the 3:2 aspect ratio inherent to the iPhone 4 and 4S to the taller, more slender 16:9 ratio of the iPhone 5.",N/A,,-1,-1
"Meaning, if you buy a device with a larger screen, you will actually get to use the larger screen.",N/A,,-1,-1
That does not mean that similar to the  Designed for iPhone 5  app updates of 2012 and 2013 we will not start seeing  Designed for iPhone 6  updates to our favorite apps.,N/A,,-1,-1
There is more screen real-estate to potentially design for.,N/A,,-1,-1
"In particular, icons, graphics and other UI elements will now need to support the @1x, @2x and the recently introduces @3x pixel sizes, otherwise things might start to look a bit blurry.",N/A,,-1,-1
Mostly iOS developers will have to learn to take advantage of some of the new Adaptive Layout features in iOS and keep their screen designs more flexible rather than pixel perfect.,N/A,,-1,-1
"Designing apps that adapt will likely be the standard for apps targeting the iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 screen sizes, but the iPhone 6 Plus may prove to be a bit more of a challenge.",N/A,,-1,-1
What is likely to prompt developers to redesign some of your favorite iPhone apps will be the changes introduced by the iPhone 6 Plus and its enhanced support for landscape mode.,N/A,,-1,-1
Many iPhone specific apps lock their orientation to portrait mode.,Many,0,0,0
You may have noticed that these particular apps do not rotate when you told your screen.,N/A,,-1,-1
"This is primarily because in many scenarios on the iPhone, landscape mode just does not have enough space to design a decent app.",N/A,,-1,-1
"With the iPhone 6 Plus s larger screen, Apple has started supporting the home screen in landscape mode as well as a more iPad-like split view for iPhone 6 Plus apps.",N/A,,-1,-1
"This will likely require some major updates to customize the user experience on the iPhone 6 Plus, especially when designing app extensions.",N/A,,-1,-1
The time it will take to redesign portrait-only screen layouts of an iPhone only app could equal that of transition to a universal app that also supports the iPad.,N/A,,-1,-1
"While supporting a wider variety of screen sizes may be new to iPhone developers, it certainly is not new to Android developers.",N/A,,-1,-1
"The latest information from Open Signal shows that as a platform, Android has become increasingly more fragmented each year when it comes to the number of manufactures, different devices, OS versions and variances in screen sizes.",N/A,,-1,-1
"There were 18,796 distinct Android devices this year compared to 11,868 last year and only 3,997 in 2012.",N/A,,-1,-1
Keeping track of all of the different screen resolutions on Android can in itself be a full-time occupation.,N/A,,-1,-1
An interesting dynamic that was added to Open Signal s analysis of the fragmentation data this year was the discovery of a correlation between the market share of the top five devices in a give market segment and that country s gross national product per capita (GDP/Capita).,N/A,,-1,-1
"The data shows that the higher the GDP/Capita, the less fragmentation there is in that country.",N/A,,-1,-1
"As an example, here in the U.S. the top five Android devices represent forty-five percent of the market.",As,0,0,0
That drastically cuts down on the number of devices one has to consider supporting compared to Madagascar where the top five devices represent only eight percent of the overall Android market.,Madagascar,1,16,16
"Apple may have just introduced a third category for asset densities within in an iPhone project (@3x), in contrast Android supports six generalized screen densities (dpi, mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, and xxxhdpi).",N/A,,-1,-1
"The goal for Android developers is to achieve what is referred to as density independence, basically avoiding situations that make graphics, buttons and icons appear oversized on different screens.",N/A,,-1,-1
And that s a situation that iPhone developers will now have to contend with.,N/A,,-1,-1
"Cloudbees  decision to drop its PaaS, or platform as a service, to focus on continuous integration and delivery is a bit like a car maker deciding to stop building cars to focus on building assembly lines instead.",N/A,,-1,-1
The analogy is imperfect but you get the picture.,N/A,,-1,-1
Continuous integration is a software engineering method which requires the merging of all working copies of a piece of software into a shared mainline or trunk repository as the project continues.,N/A,,-1,-1
"In traditional software development, integration happened infrequently or at the end of the process, which often led to all sorts of problems getting various pieces of the application to work together.",N/A,,-1,-1
"Cloudbees CEO Sacha Labourey (pictured above) said Jenkins, an open-source continuous integration (CI) product, has been a focus for a while, but now it is the sole focus as Cloudbees helps PaaS customers move to Cloud Foundry, Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku etc.",Jenkins,0,9,9
"The reason for this change of plans (or, ugh, pivot)   In the last two years the market as started to shift from continuous integration to delivery and what s interesting is that Jenkins is not only used by developers any more but is becoming the hub where dev, devops and IT people meet.",Jenkins,0,36,36
"It is where you define your end-to-end pipeline, from source repositories to Chef and Puppet deployments   it becomes your big IT orchestrator, and as such becomes as critical as your production environment,  he said.",N/A,,-1,-1
And the Jenkins ecosystem has boomed.,Jenkins,0,2,2
"Where there were 200 plug-ins a few years ago there are now at least 1,000, he said.",N/A,,-1,-1
"And, it doesn t hurt that Google has embraced Jenkins for use with Google Compute Engine and Google App Engine.",Jenkins,0,10,10

"It works, it has a huge ecosystem, it s gaining traction and is an extremely important element in continuous delivery,  he noted.",N/A,,-1,-1
He also felt it was striking that there wasn t a enterprise-grade licensed version of the tool already available.,N/A,,-1,-1
But this move also brings up the long-simmering question of whether a full PaaS is overkill for most companies.,N/A,,-1,-1
"A full PaaS encompasses a set of integrated set of services   for database, load balancing, continuous delivery etc.",N/A,,-1,-1
that developers use not just to build and test applications but to deploy them once that is done.,N/A,,-1,-1
"Schneider said Jenkins  narrower focus makes it an easier sell because the CI tool is typically selected and paid for out of the same application development budget, whereas PaaS can require buy-in from many more stakeholders.",Jenkins,0,2,2
The countervailing argument is that companies are just not ready for continuous delivery   by Jenkins or any of its competitors   yet.,Jenkins,0,14,14
"And there are competitors, products like CircleCI, Atlassian s Bamboo, Codeship, Wercker, and others.",N/A,,-1,-1
It s been a long time coming and now it s here: Amazon set its Prime Instant Video service free for Android phones.,N/A,,-1,-1
"Previously, the video app was available only for Apple iOS devices and Amazon s own Fire OS tablets and phone.",N/A,,-1,-1
"There s a bit of a catch, or hassle, however to get the software on your Android phone: You first have to install Amazon s own Appstore app.",N/A,,-1,-1
The strategy is a clever one by Amazon.,N/A,,-1,-1
"Although I don t think it will gain much by requiring its own mobile app store on Android phones for the video service, it opens the opportunity for millions of people to experience Amazon Prime.",N/A,,-1,-1
Amazon is making the Prime service available as a free 30-day trial through this software release; that could boost Prime subscriber numbers to the tune of $99 for each new user.,N/A,,-1,-1

"In June, Google announced that it was bringing Android apps to Chrome OS as an experimental feature.",N/A,,-1,-1
Details of that experiment are now coming to light: Google created a special Android runtime for Chrome that lets the mobile apps run on Chrome OS laptops and desktops.,N/A,,-1,-1
That means Android app developers don t have to modify their software to get it on Chromebooks.,N/A,,-1,-1
"However, they may need to optimize their app so that it works better with trackpads and keyboards.",N/A,,-1,-1
"For now, there are no plans to bring Android apps devices running the Chrome browser; this appears to be a strategy aimed at adding a wide range of software to Google s Chrome OS devices.",N/A,,-1,-1
"Google has also been working on its communications strategy: This week, it added free voice calls to Hangouts.",N/A,,-1,-1
Google Voice users can use their number for Caller ID purposes and voicemail messages will be added to the Hangouts conversation stream.,N/A,,-1,-1
"It s a bit of a merger between Google Voice and Hangouts, something Google has been working towards for nearly two years.",N/A,,-1,-1
"At CTIA Wireless this week, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler made a plea to mobile carriers: Commit to participating in the next year s broadcast incentive auction, so he can convince reluctant TV stations to sell their airwaves to the mobile industry.",Wheeler,0,9,9
"Smaller mobile carriers aren t quite ready to put their money on the table, though, because they re just as worried as broadcasters that they ll get a raw deal.",N/A,,-1,-1

Why  C Spire CEO Hu Meena put it rather succinctly: The FCC still owes him a rather large check.,N/A,,-1,-1
C Spire is sitting on $200 million worth of 700 MHz spectrum auction in 2008 that it has simply been unable to use.,N/A,,-1,-1
"C Spire, like many rural and regional carriers, bought licenses in a portion of the 700 MHz band called the A block, expecting to fully participate in the LTE revolution of the last several years.",N/A,,-1,-1
It was sorely mistaken.,N/A,,-1,-1
"Verizon Wireless and AT&T essentially carved out private little empires in their portions of the 700 MHz band, over which their devices   and their devices alone   would work.",N/A,,-1,-1
Many smaller carriers like C Spire and U.S. Cellular found themselves stranded on their own island of 4G spectrum called Band 12.,Many,0,0,0
And if their networks don t interoperate with the big carriers that means the devices they use are incompatible as well.,N/A,,-1,-1
"To this day, Apple still hasn t built an iPhone that works on a Band 12 network, despite commitments from AT&T and Sprint to back interoperability.",N/A,,-1,-1
"C Spire, U.S. Cellular and other carriers have managed to circumvent the problem by building their own LTE networks on the PCS bands or partner with Verizon and Sprint to lease their spectrum.",N/A,,-1,-1

"As described in a piece by editor-in-chief Alan Rusbridger on Wednesday, the new focus on live events at the Guardian (please see disclosure below) begins with the renovation of a massive former railway structure that s located near the paper s office in Kings Cross, which the newspaper company is turning into a kind of convention center or conference venue.",As,0,0,0

"That weekend convinced the Guardian that a membership-based strategy was a crucial part of its future, he says:

And so, the paper has launched a formal membership model: without paying anything, readers known as  friends  get access to all of the paper s journalism online, and can buy tickets to Guardian live events.",N/A,,-1,-1

"Seven months ago, I sat in in Chevy Corvette pushing buttons on what was supposed to be General Motors  next generation infotainment system.",N/A,,-1,-1
"The new MyLink was intended to bring a bevy of new entertainment, information and lifestyle apps into the Chevy dashboard, all accessible from GM s own app store.",N/A,,-1,-1
And an LTE radio embedded in the Corvette s roof was intended to be the primary source of connectivity for all content brought into the vehicle.,N/A,,-1,-1
AppShop never made it into the Corvette nor any of GM s new 4G cars released this summer.,N/A,,-1,-1
"Nor did promised apps like NPR, Slacker Radio, Kaliki, Glympse or Priceline.com (the exception is Pandora) roll off the lot along with new GM models.",N/A,,-1,-1
What happened  GM has abandoned its strategy of making its embedded infotainment systems the central development platform and OS for most apps in the car.,N/A,,-1,-1
"I sat down Mary Chan, GM President of the Global Connected Consumer, at CTIA Wireless this week where she candidly acknowledged that GM s connected car strategy will be dramatically different.",N/A,,-1,-1
"Instead of trying to bring every app and service to market itself, GM is leaning heavily on its new partners Apple and Google to bring core infotainment apps to the dash and relying on the smartphone to supply the connectivity for those apps.",N/A,,-1,-1
"Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are both user-interface layers that run on top of automakers  own infotainment operating systems, essentially projecting a driver-optimized version of popular apps from the smartphone onto the dashboard screen.",N/A,,-1,-1
"So instead of downloading a separate version of Spotify or Google Maps for your car, you can use the same app in your phone, interacting with it using the car s touchscreen controls or buttons.",N/A,,-1,-1
"We always knew GM was going to use Android Auto and CarPlay in some form to buff up the content in its Chevy MyLink, Cadillac Cue and Buick/GMC IntelliLink systems.",Cadillac,0,25,25
But the strategy Chan describes goes much further.,N/A,,-1,-1
"With some exceptions, GM is basically handing over development of any app that isn t directly tied to the vehicle s core driving capabilities over to Apple and Google.",N/A,,-1,-1
"Take audio streaming apps, for instance.",N/A,,-1,-1
"There are hundreds of apps delivering music, talk radio, podcasts, audio books and any other conceivable type of audio content.",N/A,,-1,-1
"To bring all of those apps to every car s infotainment system would be a nightmare for both developers and automakers, requiring direct integration and optimization of each individual app into dozens of different operating systems.",N/A,,-1,-1
"Those apps, however, are already in Google Play and the iTunes store, and since they require very little of the car s hardware resources to function   basically the display and audio speakers   only a few development tweaks would be necessary to optimize them for potentially hundreds of vehicle makes and models using CarPlay or Android Auto.",N/A,,-1,-1
"And since they would run on the phone and use its radios for internet connectivity, customers could use them without subscribing to a separate connected car data plan.",N/A,,-1,-1
"Those types of applications are great applications to be brought into the car with the smartphone,  Chan said.",N/A,,-1,-1
The types of apps we want to focus on are the ones that require a much deeper integration with the vehicle.,N/A,,-1,-1
"Those apps are the services that need to delve into GM s connected car APIs, accessing engine data, taking readings for the car s growing bevy of sensors or tapping into its telematics systems.",N/A,,-1,-1
"GM s OnStar Remote Link is a perfect example: it tracks the health of the car, monitors fuel or battery levels and supports features like remote door unlock and engine start from a smartphone.",N/A,,-1,-1
CarPlay and Android Auto s limited integration with the car means it can t perform those complex tasks.,N/A,,-1,-1
"GM s development program isn t going away, Chan said.",N/A,,-1,-1
But its focus has definitely narrowed.,N/A,,-1,-1
"What we should expect to see is many more apps from GM and its partners focused on things like remote monitoring, road safety and car location.",N/A,,-1,-1
Some specialty entertainment apps might not be out of the question either.,N/A,,-1,-1
"For instance, Gracenote is working on music algorithms that could tie listening selections to the vehicle or driver s mood, for instance playing more upbeat music when the car is cruising on a wide-open highway or more introspective music when its raining (as indicated by the car s windshield wipers).",N/A,,-1,-1
Those types of apps will need to tap more deeply into GM s APIs.,N/A,,-1,-1
"GM also needs to provide options for customers who don t have Android or iOS phones, and its developer program will remain open to more general lifestyle apps for that reason.",N/A,,-1,-1
"GM also said that the AppShop will eventually debut in GM cars to distribute those apps, though it gave no details on the timing.",N/A,,-1,-1
"In my opinion, GM s move is a very smart one.",N/A,,-1,-1
Its previous connected car approach put too much pressure on GM to build a big app ecosystem; something it or any automaker isn t equipped to do.,N/A,,-1,-1
It also required drivers to buy often expensive data plans from a single carrier AT&T (GM also announced at CTIA that it would bring OnStar 4G connectivity to Europe under its Opel brand).,N/A,,-1,-1
"AT&T will still supply connectivity for OnStar systems and GM s own homegrown apps, but drivers will no longer be required to sign up for a data plan to access services like streaming.",N/A,,-1,-1
"The new approach is actually similar to that of Ford, which has taken a smartphone-centric bring-your-own-connectivity approach since it first launched Sync AppLink.",Ford,0,9,9
"The difference is Ford still requires developers to work within its development framework, while GM is turning much of that work to Google and Apple (Ford also has signed up to use CarPlay and Android Auto in some limited fashion).",Ford,0,3,3
"The difference is Ford still requires developers to work within its development framework, while GM is turning much of that work to Google and Apple (Ford also has signed up to use CarPlay and Android Auto in some limited fashion).",Ford,0,27,27
So what precipitated GM s change of heart  Chan said it was timing.,N/A,,-1,-1
"Automakers have long development cycles and when GM was developing its infotainment strategy, CarPlay and Android Auto didn t even exist as concepts.",N/A,,-1,-1
"Both programs were only officially announced at Google s perspective developer events this year, and it was around that time that GM decided to switch gears, Chan said.",N/A,,-1,-1
The only drawback is that new GM car buyers will find their cars a lot less connected than originally promised.,N/A,,-1,-1
Pandora is available in the MyLink system and will connect to the Pandora app in your smartphone.,N/A,,-1,-1
"GM has its OnStar navigation and assistance apps, XM radio and a hotspot router that will let you to distribute the car s LTE connection to other devices via Wi-Fi.",N/A,,-1,-1
"But if you were hoping for a bevy of apps, you ll have to wait until CarPlay and Android Auto are officially available in GM cars, and GM is remaining mum about when that will be.",N/A,,-1,-1
There s a good possibility that the new MyLink and Cue systems in 2015 model cars will be able to get them with a software upgrade.,N/A,,-1,-1
"This post was update on Friday, Sept. 12, to clarify the headline and add more details about the future of the GM s AppShop and developer programs.",N/A,,-1,-1
"While much of GM s car app development will shift to CarPlay and Android Auto, MyLink and GM s other infotainment brands Cue and IntelliLink won t disappear.",N/A,,-1,-1

Although blog software such as WordPress also allows anyone to control their own home on the web   and can give them similar cross-posting features through the use of plugins   Werdmuller said that it and other older tools are still difficult for many novices to use, and while they have had features bolted on to an aging code base, Known (which is funded in part by Matter Ventures in San Francisco) was designed from the ground up to be fast and to cross-publish to social networks.",San Francisco,1,74,75

Apple didn t just deliver one mobile wallet at its iPhone 6 and Apple Watch launch event on Tuesday.,N/A,,-1,-1
It delivered two.,N/A,,-1,-1
"Its new Apple Pay service, which will launch on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in October, combines two mobile payment methods that are often conflated to represent entirely different types of transactions: using your phone in lieu of plastic to pay at the cash register, and buying goods online over your mobile phone.",N/A,,-1,-1
"Apple will bridge the two using a unified wallet that consumers will actually want to use and merchants will actually want to accept, Apple CEO Tim Cook said during his keynote (check out Gigaom s liveblog for all the details from the event).",Cook,0,27,27
"The problem with previous mobile wallets, Cook said, is that they ve been designed around self-interested business models   for instance, driving dollars into carriers  own wallets, in the case of Isis/Softcard   rather than focused on creating a great consumer experience.",Cook,0,7,7
"While Apple still has plenty of self-interested reasons to get into the mobile payments game, it definitely appears that Apple Pay is addressing many of the problems plaguing other wallets.",N/A,,-1,-1
"And as my colleague Kevin Tofel predicted last week, Apple is integrating Pay with a lot of other services and features readily available and popular on the iPhone and the overall Apple ecosystem.",N/A,,-1,-1
"First off, Apple Pay will become part of Passbook, storing your credit cards in tabs the same way it stores your boarding passes and loyalty cards.",N/A,,-1,-1

"As soon as you activate Apple Pay, you ll already have a credit card loaded: the one you use for your iTunes purchases.",As,0,0,0
Apple Pay will also be incorporated directly into the new Apple Watch.,N/A,,-1,-1
The new pieces Apple is adding to the puzzle are a near-field communications (NFC) chip and secure hardware element in the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus where credit card information is stored.,N/A,,-1,-1
"In that sense, Apple Pay will work very similarly to Isis/Softcard and other contactless wallets.",N/A,,-1,-1
The element will store unique virtual credit card numbers different from the digits imprinted on your plastic.,N/A,,-1,-1
"After a transaction is complete, the virtual numbers are replaced so your previous transaction data can t be used for fraudulent purchases.",N/A,,-1,-1
"That way the merchant never sees your credit card number, security code or even your name, said Eddy Cue, Apple SVP of internet software and services.",N/A,,-1,-1
"Apple Pay will work at 220,000 merchant locations in the U.S., including some of the biggest retailers in the country like Walgreens, Macy s, Subway, Whole Foods Market and McDonald s.

"Despite Apple s claim to have cracked the mobile payments code, we could be seeing a showdown brewing between it and some of the country s most powerful retail brands   at least in the smartphone point of sale space.",N/A,,-1,-1
"On the m-commerce front, Apple is clearly expanding its online purchasing might beyond iTunes and its various online and app stores into other retail apps and websites.",N/A,,-1,-1
PayPal has already been treading this turf since it acquired Braintree.,Braintree,0,10,10
"Last month it launched a new One Touch payment service for mobile apps that stores your card credentials in the PayPal or Venmo apps, allowing consumers to instantly purchase goods or services with a single tap.",One,0,6,6
"Apple Pay looks to do the same, except it will draw from the virtual one-time card data stored in the iPhone s hardware secure element.",N/A,,-1,-1
"Apple has also signed up some big web commerce companies to take advantage of its in-app payments, including Uber, OpenTable and even Target, which is part of the MCX consortium.",N/A,,-1,-1

"The latest version, dubbed the A8, is a 64-bit processor with 2 billion transistors   double that of the A7.",N/A,,-1,-1
"This is the second 64-bit processor from Apple, which means it can address more memory that higher-end tablets can use to run more programs faster.",N/A,,-1,-1
"The new chip uses a 20 nanometer process, which means the lines etched between transistors are smaller and thus you can shove more of them on the chip.",N/A,,-1,-1
That means the new CPU is 25 percent faster and has a 50 percent better graphics performance.,N/A,,-1,-1
"The game play shown during the event was pretty impressive, almost console quality.",N/A,,-1,-1
The smaller process node also makes the chip more energy-efficient.,N/A,,-1,-1
"With the larger screens, this may not translate to much in the way of better battery life, but it does mean those speed boosts don t come at a power cost.",N/A,,-1,-1
"Because Apple clearly views silicon as a prime differentiator, it also showed a new version of its motion-sensing co-processor, the M8.",N/A,,-1,-1

"Unlike say your smart home, which uses a hub to aggregate a bunch of Zigbee or Wi-Fi connections, or a connected vehicle fleet, which taps into the cellular network, Open Garden s IoT network would be created through millions of shared connections owned by you, me or anyone else with one of its apps on their smartphones, tablets or PCs.",N/A,,-1,-1

In the podcast he explained why Lowe s is using a subscription model and how it plans to roll out more devices over time.,N/A,,-1,-1
But Meagher points out the flaw in welcoming all of the current devices on the market today.,N/A,,-1,-1
"What s happening right now is some APIs are being opened, not all, and the only way you can actually control the device or integrate it into your ecosystem is by actually going through the cloud-to-cloud,  Meagher said.",N/A,,-1,-1
"So for example, whatever the device is, is talking to the manufacturer or the vendor s cloud platform and then they are allowing you access to their cloud s data   but if I am responsible to you with a level of service for your home so when you push a button you want your air conditioning to go on or off I m dependent on a third party that won t give me any guarantee of service   they won t give you any guarantee of service, so how is that going to work.",N/A,,-1,-1
"How is that going to scale  

One reason he s concerned about this is that Lowe s charges a $9.99 monthly subscription fee for its connected-home service, but it s doing so because it wants not only to support the backend costs of offering a platform, but also because it is trying to reach a mainstream consumer who wants one person to call when his or her lights don t work properly with a doorbell made by a different manufacturer.",One,,6,6

Amid the news that Tesla and Nevada have come to an agreement over a deal that would see Tesla s massive battery factory built in the state was another head-turning bit of information.,Nevada,,6,6

Some countries that have substantial naturally-occurring baseload clean power ( baseload  means it runs all of the time) like Iceland can run their aluminum smelting industry off of hydropower and geothermal power.,Iceland,,20,20
"But Tesla said it will meet its energy needs with not just geothermal (baseload) but also solar and wind, which are variable sources of power (meaning, they only occur at certain times of day).",N/A,,-1,-1
How it is going to do this is not entirely clear.,N/A,,-1,-1
"Will Tesla actually build and own the solar, wind and geothermal assets around the factory  If it did that, would it work with a power developer via a power purchase agreement 

Or will it buy power from clean power projects around the state, some potentially already under development, and connect the factory to the grid  If Tesla did that it would use the same amount of power from the grid as the power from the clean energy projects that it s buying from (Apple uses this model for its data centers).",N/A,,-1,-1
"If it builds its own power around the factory, will it overcome the variable nature of solar and wind using its own batteries for energy storage, storing the energy during the day to be used at night or when the wind dies down  Tesla would need some kind of way to overcome the solar and wind fluctuations, whether that s the grid, generators, or energy storage.",N/A,,-1,-1

Apple has built out two huge solar panel farms (the largest privately owned in the U.S.) that each stretch out across 100 acres and together produce 40 MW.,N/A,,-1,-1
Now Apple is building another 100 acre solar panel farm to make another about 20 MW.,N/A,,-1,-1
So Apple will have 300 acres of solar panels to power its data center (also a small fuel cell farm).,N/A,,-1,-1
"That s three hundred acres of clean power for a 500,000 square foot data center, which is less energy intensive than making batteries.",N/A,,-1,-1
And Apple doesn t power the data center directly from the panels; its solar farms put the energy onto the grid and then the data center draws the equivalent power from the grid.,N/A,,-1,-1
"Apple didn t want to invest in energy storage tech for the solar sites, as that would bump up the cost of clean power considerably.",N/A,,-1,-1

"Nevada has substantial geothermal resources, but many places don t, and thus geothermal power has long been a very small portion of the world s energy mix.",Nevada,,0,0
"The biggest expense for geothermal power is the expense of getting the wells drilled, since a portion of the wells drilled don t successfully tap into the right place to extract geothermal power.",N/A,,-1,-1
"But if Tesla, or a power producer, is willing to invest in these initial upfront costs, geothermal power is then a very low cost and baseload form of clean power once it s up and running.",N/A,,-1,-1
"However, Tesla might also be buying geothermal power from sites that are already under development and drilled.",N/A,,-1,-1
"Since Tesla said the factory will be  net energy zero,  the company might end up buying renewable energy credits (RECs) to cover any clean power that it can t buy or generate itself.",Since,,0,0
"All of these energy details will need to be worked out pretty soon, as clean energy power plants can take many months and even years to build, and Tesla wants its battery factory delivering batteries by 2017, with the ability to produce enough batteries to power 500,000 cars by 2020.",N/A,,-1,-1
At this point it s not clear how Tesla will power the world s largest lithium ion battery factory with just clean power   and clean power it says it will produce itself.,N/A,,-1,-1

"First, Lively previewed its new wearable PERS device in the form of a watch that combines a (big) button to reach emergency services, a pedometer and a medication reminder.",Lively,,2,2
It also includes  passivity sensors  to detect whether a senior s activity is reduced and alert designated family or friends when thresholds for activity are not met.,N/A,,-1,-1

It could even benefit the expected iWatch launch.,N/A,,-1,-1
Let s start with the basics: A method to use the iPhone in place of physical credit card.,N/A,,-1,-1
All signs point to a near-field communications (NFC) chip in the next iPhone and I have little reason to doubt that.,N/A,,-1,-1

"Enter the iWatch, or whatever Apple decides to call its wearable device.",Enter,,0,0
I d expect the iWatch to also have NFC and not just for simple pairing to an iPhone over Bluetooth 4.0; the device could also possibly be part of the authentication process for payments since older phones don t have Touch ID.,N/A,,-1,-1

"Simply put, neither have the clout that Apple has in two regards.",N/A,,-1,-1
"First, carriers have little control over Apple, or put another way: Carriers have more control over Google than they do over Apple.",N/A,,-1,-1
"The U.S. network providers, for example, had little incentive to push Google Wallet when they had their own wireless payment program.",N/A,,-1,-1
That s partly why Verizon Wireless customers couldn t use Google Wallet with NFC or tap-to-pay services: The carrier had the power to keep Google Wallet off of phones that ran on Verizon s network.,N/A,,-1,-1
"And unlike Apple s global aspirations, Google doesn t even support the Wallet app on phones purchased outside of the U.S.",N/A,,-1,-1
"While it clearly has relationships with them through its Wallet app, Google likely doesn t have the same influence over banks that Apple has either; not with Apple s estimated 800 million iTunes accounts.",N/A,,-1,-1
"So it wouldn t be able to work favorable deals with Master Card, Visa, Discover and American Express.",N/A,,-1,-1
It s been reported that Apple has been in discussion at least three of those four card providers and was able to cut deals directly with bank-card issuers; possibly getting lower transaction fees as a result.,N/A,,-1,-1
And that s just like Apple: It will use its considerable clout to cut in on an industry and create a new revenue stream.,N/A,,-1,-1
How might this all create more revenue for Apple  I m not yet sure but have at least one idea.,N/A,,-1,-1
"If Apple has negotiated lower rates on payment transactions, it could allow for customers to simply charge physical retail items through their iTunes account.",N/A,,-1,-1
"With the savings on transaction processing, Apple could offer incentives for shopping in the iTunes Store.",N/A,,-1,-1
"Charge your groceries to your Master Card through the iPhone, for example, and get a few dollars off the next time you buy something from iTunes.",N/A,,-1,-1
That would bring more customers to Apple s store and perhaps get them to spend more.,N/A,,-1,-1
Perhaps that s too complex of a solution though and Apple simply gets a small cut of every transaction charged through an iPhone or iWatch.,N/A,,-1,-1

"But before we mock this, recall that Washington politics is all about signaling and these words could have considerable impact.",Washington,,8,8
"For example, given that the nation s top two cable providers are attempting to merge in a deal that would be horrendous for U.S. broadband and pay TV subscribers, is the agency perhaps telling Comcast that its efforts to say the deal is all about pay TV aren t holding water  Or reminding everyone that the cable companies, barring a few planned gigabit networks, are the purveyors of the dominant form of high speed broadband access in the U.S.",N/A,,-1,-1
"The FCC, in other words, is specifically calling out the lack of competition when it comes to higher speeds.",N/A,,-1,-1
"Wheeler s speech included the following chart to drive home this point:

Outside of the hidden messages, the Chairman offered clear statements.",Wheeler,,0,0
"He called on the FCC to create principles to increase competition that are as follows:

Protect existing competition: The chairman pointed to the agency s efforts to oppose wireless mergers as an example of this and said that, when it comes to transitioning from older copper networks to newer IP networks, the shifts should not reduce competition.",N/A,,-1,-1
"He did not mention Comcast s planned merger, which is the elephant in the room.",N/A,,-1,-1
"Encourage competition where it can exist: In wireline, Wheeler mentioned both the power of last-mile providers and ensuring that last-mile access remains free from barriers.",Wheeler,,10,10
"In wireless, he mentioned setting aside spectrum in the Broadcast Incentive Auction for alternative options which I m guessing refer to white spaces and Wi-Fi.",N/A,,-1,-1
Create competition where none exists: He against referred to unlicensed spectrum as well as the current fight for Chattanooga s Electric Company to help provide gigabit services to nearby towns   something currently forbidden by state laws that were drafted with help from telecoms companies.,Chattanooga,,19,19
"Provide broadband where competition can t exist: This was Wheeler s shout out to rural America, where wireline is both expensive to lay and there s little incentive to invest.",Wheeler,,10,10
"Provide broadband where competition can t exist: This was Wheeler s shout out to rural America, where wireline is both expensive to lay and there s little incentive to invest.",America,,16,16

"The principles aside, Wheeler also derided the agency s current definition of broadband at 4 Mbps.",Wheeler,,4,4
"Speaking of the chart higher up in the story, he said:

He went further, indicating that 25 Mbps was really the current  tablestakes  goal for minimum broadband and pointed out that while a majority of American homes have access to 100 Mbps broadband, 40 percent do not.",N/A,,-1,-1
"He called that unacceptable, while essentially tossing the efficacy of DSL lines out the window as a quality broadband option.",N/A,,-1,-1
"The telcos have known this for more than a decade, but only when the threat of competition from cable companies deploying faster speeds and now Google s gigabit plans have prompted them to move faster in upgrading their networks.",N/A,,-1,-1
"The Chairman said essentially the same things the Gig.U report I covered last month said: that gigabit isn t just fast, but it s spurring competitive investment that otherwise may never have happened.",N/A,,-1,-1
"Wheeler likely irked the telco s further in explaining that mobile broadband isn t an adequate substitute for fixed broadband,  especially given mobile pricing levels and limited data allowances.",Wheeler,,0,0
"We ve said this all along, and it s not like agency hasn t realized this for years, but saying it so publicly is a nice first step.",N/A,,-1,-1
"So what s driving Wheeler to tell off the industry his agency regulates  My guess is that he realizes that creating any kind of meaningful network neutrality is impossible, so he has to go for the nuclear option.",Wheeler,,4,4
"Not reclassification, but calling out the industry for the lack of competition that is why we need network neutrality in the first place.",N/A,,-1,-1
"This is the first of several speeches the FCC will offer on this topic, we ll have to wait and see how the agency lines up its ideals on competition with policy-making.",N/A,,-1,-1
It s much harder to say all of these things and then approve a merger that would put more American s under a broadband data cap and reduce the number of wireline broadband competitors or say no to a request to broaden the options businesses have for faster broadband access.,N/A,,-1,-1
"But the chairman was also very clear that he s aiming to incentive competition, not mandate it.",N/A,,-1,-1
Which means the behind-the-scenes negotiations between the agency and the ISPs may put the lie to Chairman s pro-competition rhetoric today in ways the average citizen won t see or understand until they are stuck paying $90 a month for 50 Mbps broadband that comes with a data cap.,N/A,,-1,-1
