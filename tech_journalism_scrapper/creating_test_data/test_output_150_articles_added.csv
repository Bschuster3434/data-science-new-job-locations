"In fact, the TV industry s lobbying arm, the National Association of Broadcasters, has gone to the courts trying to get the auction stopped.",N/A,-1,-1
The NAB is challenging it on grounds that broadcasters who choose to remain on air won t have their signals protected when the band is rearranged for 4G services.,N/A,-1,-1

"Unlike the vision proposed today by a group of IBM researchers, Apigee s idea is dependent on the cloud, where the APIs Apigee manages live.",N/A,-1,-1
"Zetta, as the platform is called, takes the idea that the internet of things is about using APIs to take advantage of all the data that connected devices can collect and then letting developers build services on top of them.",N/A,-1,-1
It s an app-centric model with intelligence in the cloud as opposed to a device-centric model with intelligence on the hardware and at the edge.,N/A,-1,-1
"Mulloy describes the architecture as one that allows for a hub and spoke physical network topology, while abstracting that to look like a flat graph-like topology in the cloud.",N/A,-1,-1
So in the real world we have a hub and spokes be they wearables all talking to a smartphone or a bunch of lightbulbs talking to a bridge.,N/A,-1,-1
"In the cloud, however, that model creates a mess for developers, so then each object becomes a node and the APIs govern what can talk to what and how.",N/A,-1,-1
"This model offers some strengths in that the hub-and-spoke model is clearly dominant today, and using APIs allows people to use third-party authentication between their devices in a way that makes it easy to hook my TCP lights into my Wink hub with just a password entered via the app.",N/A,-1,-1
That helps handle issues of interoperability between different devices and allows services like If This Then That to flourish and expand what we think we can do with the internet of things.,N/A,-1,-1
"However, hooking everything into the cloud creates operation costs and complexities for the hardware vendor and the consumer.",N/A,-1,-1
"Operating a cloud backend costs money, which may mean that customers are charged a service fee over time.",N/A,-1,-1

Recently things have changed significantly.,N/A,-1,-1
Traditional WAN optimization was mainly conceived for solving lack of bandwidth in a time when legacy protocols were designed for local area network (LAN) connectivity.,N/A,-1,-1
"Data was neither compressed nor encrypted, and computers were unable to manage huge amounts of complex data.",N/A,-1,-1
"Now things are the other way around: High-bandwidth links (10Gbs or more) are considerably cheaper than in the past, new protocols are emerging, data is often compressed and encrypted at the source, and even mobile devices can concurrently manage multiple huge data streams.",N/A,-1,-1
Traditional WAN optimization was simply not designed to efficiently manage these new requirements .,N/A,-1,-1

"The researchers used a type of deep learning model (a stacked denoising autoencoder, to be precise) in order to predict players  goals in video games that don t have a set series of challenges, specified order of events or set-in-stone solution paths.",N/A,-1,-1
"You can imagine the artificial intelligence engine in a game ramping up the obstacles, or perhaps guidance, as it figures out what a player is actually trying to accomplish at any given time.",N/A,-1,-1
"The researchers looked at five types of data generated during gameplay   action state, action argument, location, narrative state and previously achieved goals   and their system was able to classify with 62.3 percent accuracy what goals a player was trying to achieve.",N/A,-1,-1
"According to their paper, that s a nearly 29 percent improvement over previous approaches.",N/A,-1,-1
"The researchers gathered their data by analyzing the gameplay of 137 eight-graders on Crystal Island, an educational gaming environment developed at NCSU.",Crystal,13,13
"And better yet, while previous approaches required researchers to hand code the features their models needed to analyze, the deep learning approach was able to learn representations of the pertinent features on its own.",N/A,-1,-1
While such a limited study is far from definitive proof that deep learning could revolutionize artificial intelligence in different types of games (many of today s commercial titles are probably much more advanced in terms of the number of possibilities and the number of things going on) it is a good example of the possible applications of deep-learning-based pattern recognition beyond what it s currently known for.,N/A,-1,-1
"In fact, DeepMind, the startup Google bought for $400 million in January, had already trained a deep learning system to learn the rules of video game just by analyzing gameplay data.",N/A,-1,-1
"And I d be willing to bet there are a handful of gaming companies already applying deep learning, at least in their labs, to see if they can do just what the NCSU researchers did, but on a bigger scale and with real games.",N/A,-1,-1
Apple didn t just deliver one mobile wallet at its iPhone 6 and Apple Watch launch event on Tuesday.,N/A,-1,-1
It delivered two.,N/A,-1,-1
"Its new Apple Pay service, which will launch on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in October, combines two mobile payment methods that are often conflated to represent entirely different types of transactions: using your phone in lieu of plastic to pay at the cash register, and buying goods online over your mobile phone.",N/A,-1,-1
"Apple will bridge the two using a unified wallet that consumers will actually want to use and merchants will actually want to accept, Apple CEO Tim Cook said during his keynote (check out Gigaom s liveblog for all the details from the event).",Cook,27,27
"The problem with previous mobile wallets, Cook said, is that they ve been designed around self-interested business models   for instance, driving dollars into carriers  own wallets, in the case of Isis/Softcard   rather than focused on creating a great consumer experience.",Cook,7,7
"While Apple still has plenty of self-interested reasons to get into the mobile payments game, it definitely appears that Apple Pay is addressing many of the problems plaguing other wallets.",N/A,-1,-1
"And as my colleague Kevin Tofel predicted last week, Apple is integrating Pay with a lot of other services and features readily available and popular on the iPhone and the overall Apple ecosystem.",N/A,-1,-1
"First off, Apple Pay will become part of Passbook, storing your credit cards in tabs the same way it stores your boarding passes and loyalty cards.",N/A,-1,-1
It will use Touch ID to verify consumer identity and presence at the point of sale.,N/A,-1,-1
And it will make use of the 800 million credit cards it already has on file attached to users  Apple IDs.,N/A,-1,-1
"As soon as you activate Apple Pay, you ll already have a credit card loaded: the one you use for your iTunes purchases.",As,0,0
Apple Pay will also be incorporated directly into the new Apple Watch.,N/A,-1,-1
The new pieces Apple is adding to the puzzle are a near-field communications (NFC) chip and secure hardware element in the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus where credit card information is stored.,N/A,-1,-1
"In that sense, Apple Pay will work very similarly to Isis/Softcard and other contactless wallets.",N/A,-1,-1
The element will store unique virtual credit card numbers different from the digits imprinted on your plastic.,N/A,-1,-1
"After a transaction is complete, the virtual numbers are replaced so your previous transaction data can t be used for fraudulent purchases.",N/A,-1,-1
"That way the merchant never sees your credit card number, security code or even your name, said Eddy Cue, Apple SVP of internet software and services.",N/A,-1,-1
"Apple Pay will work at 220,000 merchant locations in the U.S., including some of the biggest retailers in the country like Walgreens, Macy s, Subway, Whole Foods Market and McDonald s.

"On the m-commerce front, Apple is clearly expanding its online purchasing might beyond iTunes and its various online and app stores into other retail apps and websites.",N/A,-1,-1
PayPal has already been treading this turf since it acquired Braintree.,Braintree,10,10
"Last month it launched a new One Touch payment service for mobile apps that stores your card credentials in the PayPal or Venmo apps, allowing consumers to instantly purchase goods or services with a single tap.",One,6,6
"Apple Pay looks to do the same, except it will draw from the virtual one-time card data stored in the iPhone s hardware secure element.",N/A,-1,-1
"Apple has also signed up some big web commerce companies to take advantage of its in-app payments, including Uber, OpenTable and even Target, which is part of the MCX consortium.",N/A,-1,-1

Along with two new iPhones and a host of other goodies associated with Tuesday s Apple event was an upgrade of the Apple-designed ARM-based application processor.,N/A,-1,-1
"The latest version, dubbed the A8, is a 64-bit processor with 2 billion transistors   double that of the A7.",N/A,-1,-1
"This is the second 64-bit processor from Apple, which means it can address more memory that higher-end tablets can use to run more programs faster.",N/A,-1,-1
"The new chip uses a 20 nanometer process, which means the lines etched between transistors are smaller and thus you can shove more of them on the chip.",N/A,-1,-1
That means the new CPU is 25 percent faster and has a 50 percent better graphics performance.,N/A,-1,-1
"The game play shown during the event was pretty impressive, almost console quality.",N/A,-1,-1
The smaller process node also makes the chip more energy-efficient.,N/A,-1,-1
"With the larger screens, this may not translate to much in the way of better battery life, but it does mean those speed boosts don t come at a power cost.",N/A,-1,-1
"Because Apple clearly views silicon as a prime differentiator, it also showed a new version of its motion-sensing co-processor, the M8.",N/A,-1,-1
"The new M8 chip can estimate distance and track elevation (such as flights of stairs), and has a barometer sensor.",N/A,-1,-1
This chip is designed to take the weight of calculating data from the accelerometers and gyroscopes off the CPU.,N/A,-1,-1
"In practical terms, it means that the iPhone can count your steps and activities without taking a battery cut from switching the cPU on.",N/A,-1,-1

"Apple is calling its new display Retina HD, and according to Apple SVP Phil Schiller, the panels sport higher contrast, deeper blacks and wider viewing angles than before.",N/A,-1,-1
"The 4.7-inch iPhone will run at 1334 x 750 resolution, and the 5.5-inch iPhone will run at a 1920 x 1080 resolution.",N/A,-1,-1
This means that the smaller iPhone screen have 326 pixels per inch and the bigger phone will have 401 ppi.,N/A,-1,-1
Older apps will continue to work on the larger iPhones thanks to a  desktop class scaler.,N/A,-1,-1
Both phones have received a complete physical redesign.,N/A,-1,-1
"The new look actually has a little bit of the original iPhone in it, with rounded corners and a smooth aluminum shell.",N/A,-1,-1
"There are two cutout bands on the top and bottom of the back side, and a new, slightly protruding camera near the top.",N/A,-1,-1
"Apple has dropped the circular volume buttons and gone with skinny, pill-shaped buttons that resemble those on the iPhone 5c and iPod touch.",N/A,-1,-1
"Both new devices are thinner than the previous devices: According to Apple, the iPhone 6 is 6.9mm thick, and the iPhone 6 Plus is slightly thicker, at 7.1mm.",N/A,-1,-1
"If you were worried that the bigger screen could introduce ergonomics issues, Apple has added a new  reachability  feature to the iPhone 6 Plus, which is activated by double-tapping the Touch ID button.",N/A,-1,-1
"The iPhone 6 Plus home screen will gain a landscape mode, with dock buttons moving to the right hand side.",N/A,-1,-1
One of the big draws for the new iPhones is shaping up to be battery life.,One,0,0
"The newest iPhone will have  equal or better battery life in almost every metric than the iPhone 5s,  Schiller said.",N/A,-1,-1
"The iPhone 6 Plus, due to its larger battery, will get more run time than the iPhone 6, but you can expect both to beat the iPhones currently on the market.",N/A,-1,-1
"Both iPhones will be powered by Apple s latest system-on-a-chip, the A8.",N/A,-1,-1
It s a 64-bit chip forged on a 20 nanometer process.,N/A,-1,-1
"Apple promises 25 percent faster CPU performance and 50 percent faster graphics performances, but many of its real-world gains will come from a reduction in power consumption.",N/A,-1,-1
Schiller said the chip is 50 percent more energy efficient.,N/A,-1,-1
"Apple has added a few new components to the A8 SoC, including a new M8 sensor and motion coprocessor, which now comes with a barometer sensor.",N/A,-1,-1
The camera has clearly been a point of emphasis.,N/A,-1,-1
"The new iPhone comes with an 8 megapixel shooter, with a f/2.2 aperture lens.",N/A,-1,-1

Companies in search of rapid service provisioning for many concurrent users increasingly adopt the public and private Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) category of cloud services to address their needs.,N/A,-1,-1

The biggest question that public cloud providers must answer today is how to deploy PaaS as a major component of their cloud services.,N/A,-1,-1
Cloud providers can take a do-it-yourself approach to PaaS using open-source CloudFoundry and OpenShift or partner with a commercial white label PaaS provider.,N/A,-1,-1

"White label PaaS is a new approach that can help new or existing cloud providers (IaaS and SaaS) catch up with the big three (AWS, Google, and Microsoft) by offering public IaaS and public PaaS under the same brand hosted on their own infrastructure or a third party s.

Open Garden believes it now has enough users out there to execute the next the stage of its plan: it wants to use all of these smartphone nodes to create a new network for the internet of things.,N/A,-1,-1
This concept probably requires some explaining as it doesn t fit into any of the other IoT networking schemes we ve written about in the past.,N/A,-1,-1
"Unlike say your smart home, which uses a hub to aggregate a bunch of Zigbee or Wi-Fi connections, or a connected vehicle fleet, which taps into the cellular network, Open Garden s IoT network would be created through millions of shared connections owned by you, me or anyone else with one of its apps on their smartphones, tablets or PCs.",N/A,-1,-1
Open Garden s apps all have one thing in common: they create networks on the fly from the connections all around us.,N/A,-1,-1
"These kind of ad hoc networks will connect nearby smartphones and tablets, each of which will act as node that can either receive data or pass it along.",N/A,-1,-1
Open Garden s apps then use these networks for different things.,N/A,-1,-1
"In the case of FireChat, those ad hoc Bluetooth or Wi-Fi networks let nearby users communicate without an internet connection, passing their conversations through a chain of intermeshed smartphones.",N/A,-1,-1
"In the case of its bandwidth-sharing app, devices within the same mesh network can borrow each other s internet connections.",N/A,-1,-1
"The underlying ad hoc networking technology is the same though the applications themselves are different, said Christophe Daligault, Open Garden VP of marketing and sales.",N/A,-1,-1
"That means there is plenty of opportunity to hang more apps and devices on Open Garden s network, and it s starting at the CTIA Wireless conference in Las Vegas, where it announced a partnership with smart tag maker TrackR.",Las Vegas,29,30
TrackR s Bluetooth-enabled tracking tags already use ad hoc networking to help you find your lost items.,N/A,-1,-1
"If you report an item lost, its tag will start reaching out to other TrackR users via their smartphone apps.",N/A,-1,-1
"If the network detects a lost tag it will report its location to its rightful owner, dropping a pin on a map.",N/A,-1,-1
What Open Garden is doing is greatly expanding the scope of that locator network by allowing TrackR tags to communicate with every smartphone with the FireChat or Open Garden app.,N/A,-1,-1
Basically TrackR is putting millions more phones on the lookout for its customers  lost goods.,N/A,-1,-1
It all happens in the background so users FireChat aren t interrupting their own smartphone activities to hunt for a lost set of keys or misplaced bag.,N/A,-1,-1
"And that s just one of many possible apps that could make use of the network, Daligault said.",N/A,-1,-1
"Instead of relying on Wi-Fi or cellular, sensor networks could rely on ad hoc networks to intermittently upload your data.",N/A,-1,-1

"The more nodes on the network, the more chance any given device can form a connection, and the more benefit accrues to every service and user on the network   even if each individual user is only using one of the possible applications.",N/A,-1,-1
"Of course, this kind of shared networking comes with controversy.",N/A,-1,-1
It s one thing for Open Garden to ask its customers to participate directly in a shared messaging network like FireChat.,N/A,-1,-1
It s another thing to ask them to use their phones as way-stations for other traffic they have no interest in and control over.,N/A,-1,-1
"Though the TrackR device connecting to your FireChat phone is only sending the minutest amount of data over its cellular connection, it s still using your data plan all the same.",N/A,-1,-1
"Open Garden, however, has been emphasizing from is foundation that these kinds of trade-offs will be necessary if we re to build an internet where all things are connected efficiently and cheaply at all times.",N/A,-1,-1
"While the person or device next to you may be using your internet connection to transfer his data one day, your device or tablet might be using his radio the next.",N/A,-1,-1
"And though Open Garden claims its network is secure, keeping transient data isolated from the data on its devices, any time one device connects to another, the risk of security breach always increases.",N/A,-1,-1

"How is that going to scale  

One reason he s concerned about this is that Lowe s charges a $9.99 monthly subscription fee for its connected-home service, but it s doing so because it wants not only to support the backend costs of offering a platform, but also because it is trying to reach a mainstream consumer who wants one person to call when his or her lights don t work properly with a doorbell made by a different manufacturer.",One,6,6

"The profiles offer features helpful for those in the food industry, such an emphasis on visual content like food porn photos and videos of the chefs at work.",N/A,-1,-1
"Before starting Chef s Roll, company co-founder and CEO Thomas Keslinke gained 14 years of experience in hospitality, restaurant, and catering management.",Thomas,10,10
"LinkedIn falls short on giving the creative industries the ability to showcase their talents,  he told me.",N/A,-1,-1
Keslinke and his co-founder have bootstrapped the company on a freemium selling plan but tell me they re now shopping for investors.,N/A,-1,-1
"It may be a struggle for the duo, unless they can prove that the market of chef recruiters   and the companies who want to sell equipment to chefs   are both sizeable enough to generate venture-backed returns.",N/A,-1,-1
"Before you giggle and immediately dismiss the idea of LinkedIn for chefs, it s worth noting that Chef s Roll is following a trend set by some pretty big startups.",N/A,-1,-1
"Although you might think that specialized LinkedIns wouldn t attract big enough audiences for venture bets, that hasn t been the case.",N/A,-1,-1
"One of the oldest and biggest players is Spiceworks, a social network for IT professionals.",One,0,0
"The company counts one third of the world s IT professionals among its users, and it has raised more than $111 million in venture funds, with the last round led by none other than Goldman Sachs.",N/A,-1,-1

Doximity has more than a third of the nation s doctors on it.,N/A,-1,-1
"It has specific features that keep its users engaged, like a secure, HIPAA compliant e-fax technology and an alert system for academic articles published on obscure topics.",N/A,-1,-1
Companies that build healthcare or IT tools and technologies are willing to pay big to reach Doximity and Spiceworks users.,N/A,-1,-1
Institutions looking to hire such employees are happy to cough up the recruiting fee to post open jobs.,N/A,-1,-1
"In these industries, these targeted LinkedIns are money-makers.",N/A,-1,-1
But will that be the case with Chef s Roll  The website is early enough in its history that it hasn t penetrated much of the market.,N/A,-1,-1
"Keslinke told me they only have 3,600 users, and are aiming for a market of  10 million  worldwide.",N/A,-1,-1
"He envisions a future much like the experience of Doximity and Spiceworks, where culinary equipment companies pay to advertise to the curated audience of chefs, or where hospitality brands cough up the big bucks for recruiting.",N/A,-1,-1
"But that day is a long way away, and there s no evidence that the  chef  market is as big as IT, science, or healthcare industries.",N/A,-1,-1
"Ben Boyer, Managing Director at Tenaya Capital, built one of his investment theses around vertical professional social networks, having placed bets in Spiceworks, Edmodo, and ResearchGate.",N/A,-1,-1
"Although he said he couldn t speak to Chef s Roll in particular since he wasn t familiar with it, he offered insight into the key elements a company like Chef s Roll needs to succeed from a venture perspective.",N/A,-1,-1
"First and foremost, such a company should provide a key service to its users, such that they flock in droves.",N/A,-1,-1
ResearchGate does that by providing an easy feature for scientists across the world to collaborate on research.,N/A,-1,-1
Spiceworks does it by offering a free network management tool to IT pros.,N/A,-1,-1
Both have reached huge chunks of their target markets.,N/A,-1,-1
"On the surface, Chef s Roll doesn t have that key service.",N/A,-1,-1
"It s a prettier profile than LinkedIn, with more room for showing food presentation, but it doesn t offer a feature that s key for a chef to do his or her job.",N/A,-1,-1
The second element that Boyer looks for in vertical professional social networks is the size   and selling strength   of the target market.,N/A,-1,-1
"Is the audience valuable 

 I have no knowledge or insight of chefs,  Boyer told me.",N/A,-1,-1
"Is there a big enough need for chef hiring  How much is being spent today by restaurants and related businesses to recruit chefs   By way of comparison, there are 115,000 chefs and head cooks in the United States, according to the Department of Labor, as opposed to 691,000 physicians and surgeons.",United States,37,38
"If you widen the criteria a little, the market gets bigger: There are 2.15 million  cooks  in the United States, which would include anyone from the fry cook at the local burger joint to the sous chef at the five star French restaurant.",United States,20,21
"Some of them might need Chef s Roll s help to apply for jobs, but others would not.",N/A,-1,-1
"If its too niche of a market, Chef s Roll may do better as a bootstrapped company instead of one trying to bring in VC-level scaling returns.",N/A,-1,-1

And Apple doesn t power the data center directly from the panels; its solar farms put the energy onto the grid and then the data center draws the equivalent power from the grid.,N/A,-1,-1
"Apple didn t want to invest in energy storage tech for the solar sites, as that would bump up the cost of clean power considerably.",N/A,-1,-1

"For some, that may be disappointing.",N/A,-1,-1
"Don t overlook, however, the charging method found in the Moto X because it can recharge the phone far faster than a wireless charging pad and even quicker than a standard USB plug with an optional Turbo Charger.",Turbo,38,38

"IHS segments the overall market into six buckets   independent living services, consumer medical devices, telehealth, personal emergency response systems (PERS), wearable technologies and health gaming.",N/A,-1,-1
There was a flurry of product release news on tech-for-seniors front this week.,N/A,-1,-1
"First, Lively previewed its new wearable PERS device in the form of a watch that combines a (big) button to reach emergency services, a pedometer and a medication reminder.",Lively,2,2
It also includes  passivity sensors  to detect whether a senior s activity is reduced and alert designated family or friends when thresholds for activity are not met.,N/A,-1,-1
"And because many older seniors may not have Wi-Fi in their homes, it relies on cellular service along with an in-home hub so that the device works within 1,000 feet of the base.",N/A,-1,-1
"The watch, pictured below, can also be paired with a smartphone to operate when the user is out and about.",N/A,-1,-1
"The unit costs $49.95, with service coming in at another $34.95 per month.",N/A,-1,-1
"Forrester Research senior analyst Julie Ask said one key to success in this market is making the technology so easy that it disappears into the woodwork   it needs super-long-life batteries, and a very easy and legible UI, both of which Lively has thought out.",Lively,42,42
Big buttons are key for a population with vision problems and a watch is something that many in this demographic already use so the form factor won t be jarring.,N/A,-1,-1
"The idea that a wearable device would note when its wearer has gone from 4,000 steps a day to 1,000 or less and ping a distant family member is pretty appealing.",N/A,-1,-1

"It s good that these companies are researching the needs of this rapidly growing population, but there are a couple of caveats.",N/A,-1,-1
"First, it seems that some of these vendors (I m looking at you, AARP and Intel!",N/A,-1,-1

That is a mistake.,N/A,-1,-1
"There s a huge difference between 50- and 60-somethings, and older seniors in their eighties and nineties.",N/A,-1,-1
That population is much less likely to be device-savvy and more likely to have vision and hearing impairments.,N/A,-1,-1
"For them, a whole other class of technology is needed   big-buttoned watches and smartphones might be of use, or perhaps a home sensor network connected to loved ones.",N/A,-1,-1
Aging in place is a killer application area for the internet of things.,N/A,-1,-1
"If you or your grandmother can control her lights and coffee maker from a smartphone or easy to use tablet, that s great.",N/A,-1,-1
It s even better if you can be discreetly apprised of her level of activity and alerted if she doesn t take her pills on time.,N/A,-1,-1
The dark side of that is making sure that only you or other authorized people are on the receiving end of that data.,N/A,-1,-1
"Seniors living alone with devices silently beaming out information about what they re doing and when, about their mobility and state of health, also means big-time security issues.",N/A,-1,-1

"Last week, I was out with my family at an outdoor shopping center.",N/A,-1,-1

Next week at an Apple press event   we ll be there with a live-blog on Tuesday   we re very likely to hear that Apple has cracked the mobile wallet challenge where so many others in the U.S. have failed.,N/A,-1,-1
"And that pop-up notification from my Starbucks Card, which is also in my Apple Passbook app, got me thinking of how Apple may succeed in the wireless payment space with all of the right moving parts in place at just the right time.",N/A,-1,-1
It could even benefit the expected iWatch launch.,N/A,-1,-1
Let s start with the basics: A method to use the iPhone in place of physical credit card.,N/A,-1,-1
All signs point to a near-field communications (NFC) chip in the next iPhone and I have little reason to doubt that.,N/A,-1,-1
"Last week, I offered two reasons that NFC in the iPhone 6 makes sense both for payments and for simple pairing of Bluetooth accessories, such as a wearable device.",N/A,-1,-1
"For many mainstream consumers, this would be new technology but of course, it s been around for several years.",N/A,-1,-1
"That doesn t matter to the people who ve never used NFC in either instance; it will be a desirable, new experience.",N/A,-1,-1
There s a problem though.,N/A,-1,-1
"If only the new iPhone   or iPhones, assuming two size options   have an NFC chip, how will the tens of millions of current iPhone owners be part of this new mobile payment revolution  Sure, folks can upgrade but not everyone who owns an iPhone will do so.",N/A,-1,-1
"Enter the iWatch, or whatever Apple decides to call its wearable device.",Enter,0,0
I d expect the iWatch to also have NFC and not just for simple pairing to an iPhone over Bluetooth 4.0; the device could also possibly be part of the authentication process for payments since older phones don t have Touch ID.,N/A,-1,-1
"If so, you could use the iWatch in lieu of an iPhone to pay for items in retail stores.",N/A,-1,-1
"Since the wearable device connects to an iPhone, the wallet application could work with the accessory.",Since,0,0
"And guess what: Every iPhone that Apple currently sells   the iPhone 4s, 5c and 5s   supports Bluetooth 4.0, which could link NFC on the wrist and a wallet app on the phone.",N/A,-1,-1
This not only brings a wider audience to Apple s wireless payment implementation but also gives more people incentive to buy the iWatch: A double-win for Apple.,N/A,-1,-1
Going back to my Starbucks  out of store  experience   it actually did get me to go in and buy an espresso   adds another potential twist to Apple s wallet aspirations: iBeacon.,N/A,-1,-1
We haven t heard much of late about the small Bluetooth devices that can pinpoint your indoor location.,N/A,-1,-1
These launched with iOS 7 last year and some retailers have added them in the past 12 months.,N/A,-1,-1
The reason my iPhone surfaced my Starbucks Card last week was because it detected I was near the coffee shop.,N/A,-1,-1
"It can do this with GPS, Wi-Fi or both and it s pretty handy.",N/A,-1,-1
"Apple can take things a step further, though, with iBeacon.",N/A,-1,-1
Perhaps the wallet app or Passbook pops up a coupon or other promotion when iBeacons recognize I m actually just outside or in a store.,N/A,-1,-1
"Better yet, since iBeacons can pinpoint indoor proximity to a more precise level, my iPhone could realize when I m in the checkout line of a store.",N/A,-1,-1
The wallet app or store card for that particular location could magically surface just the right card so I don t have to fumble around with a dozen piece of plastic in my physical wallet.,N/A,-1,-1
"Think of it as a contextual experience when paying: The right time, place and card.",N/A,-1,-1
"None of this is possible without the right backing, however.",None,0,0
And it speaks volumes to why Google Wallet and the carrier payment systems   first dubbed Isis and now called Softcard   have generally been a bust.,N/A,-1,-1
"Simply put, neither have the clout that Apple has in two regards.",N/A,-1,-1
"First, carriers have little control over Apple, or put another way: Carriers have more control over Google than they do over Apple.",N/A,-1,-1
"The U.S. network providers, for example, had little incentive to push Google Wallet when they had their own wireless payment program.",N/A,-1,-1
That s partly why Verizon Wireless customers couldn t use Google Wallet with NFC or tap-to-pay services: The carrier had the power to keep Google Wallet off of phones that ran on Verizon s network.,N/A,-1,-1
"And unlike Apple s global aspirations, Google doesn t even support the Wallet app on phones purchased outside of the U.S.",N/A,-1,-1
"While it clearly has relationships with them through its Wallet app, Google likely doesn t have the same influence over banks that Apple has either; not with Apple s estimated 800 million iTunes accounts.",N/A,-1,-1
"So it wouldn t be able to work favorable deals with Master Card, Visa, Discover and American Express.",N/A,-1,-1
It s been reported that Apple has been in discussion at least three of those four card providers and was able to cut deals directly with bank-card issuers; possibly getting lower transaction fees as a result.,N/A,-1,-1
And that s just like Apple: It will use its considerable clout to cut in on an industry and create a new revenue stream.,N/A,-1,-1
How might this all create more revenue for Apple  I m not yet sure but have at least one idea.,N/A,-1,-1
"If Apple has negotiated lower rates on payment transactions, it could allow for customers to simply charge physical retail items through their iTunes account.",N/A,-1,-1
"With the savings on transaction processing, Apple could offer incentives for shopping in the iTunes Store.",N/A,-1,-1
"Charge your groceries to your Master Card through the iPhone, for example, and get a few dollars off the next time you buy something from iTunes.",N/A,-1,-1
That would bring more customers to Apple s store and perhaps get them to spend more.,N/A,-1,-1
Perhaps that s too complex of a solution though and Apple simply gets a small cut of every transaction charged through an iPhone or iWatch.,N/A,-1,-1
"That s how Apple makes its money now from the sale of music, video and apps and is the more likely scenario.",N/A,-1,-1
"Regardless of how this all pans out next week, it s clear to me that out of everyone in the mobile industry, only Apple currently has all of the pieces of the mobile payment puzzle for a chance of success.",N/A,-1,-1
"It s not just the clout of Apple, the devices, and the software to pull this off.",N/A,-1,-1
It s the combination and control of these things that no other company can currently offer.,N/A,-1,-1
"After the Moto 360 went on sale earlier today, consumers who want a little bit of Android on their wrist will have at least six different options.",N/A,-1,-1
"Even though Android Wear may not be a must-have yet, the platform still offers a lot for people who are heavily plugged into Google s ecosystem.",N/A,-1,-1
"Although Google has designed Android Wear to work the same on most devices, there s still a surprising amount of cosmetic and functional differences between the models.",N/A,-1,-1

Four big tech companies embroiled in a Silicon Valley hiring controversy are appealing a judge s decision to reject a settlement that would have seen them pay $325 million to settle a class action case brought engineers and other employees.,Valley,8,8
"According to Reuters, the companies   Apple, Google, Adobe and Intel   have described  U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh s decision last month as  rigid and formulaic  and suggested that rejecting the deal would serve to waste years of court time.",N/A,-1,-1
"The underlying controversy turns on an alleged conspiracy by some of the tech world s biggest names, including the late Steve Jobs of Apple and Sergey Brin of Google, in which their companies agreed not to recruit each others  employees.",N/A,-1,-1
"The employees sued to recover wages lost as a result of the conspiracy, leading to the proposed settlement earlier this year.",N/A,-1,-1
"Ordinarily, courts are quick to approve such deals but Judge Koh decided to reject it as too low in light of a similar settlement involving Pixar, Lucas Films and Intuit.",Lucas,28,28
"Based on that earlier settlement, Koh said, Apple and the three other companies should offer at least $380 million.",N/A,-1,-1

That doesn t really matter to us.,N/A,-1,-1
The player should play equally well on a PC-based platform as it would on a mobile-based.,N/A,-1,-1
"That s thanks in part to the Gear VR-compatible Galaxy Note 4 s 2560 x 1440 resolution screen which, while it has A lower resolution than the screen planned for the final version of Oculus Rift, is more than enough to trick the brain into believing what it is seeing is real.",N/A,-1,-1
But it also has to do with the relatively small amount of processing power needed to play a video.,N/A,-1,-1
You can easily watch YouTube videos and even TV on a phone because the heavy computing is done in advance.,N/A,-1,-1
You don t need an Xbox-caliber machine to have a high-quality experience.,N/A,-1,-1
"If you have a headset plugged into a high powered PC or some other console, then you would have more processing power.",N/A,-1,-1
"That s important for a lot of applications, but it s less important for a cinematic VR viewer,  Christensen said.",N/A,-1,-1
We feel the consumer is giving up very little and gaining a lot by being untethered.,N/A,-1,-1
"While many of us do it anyway, it s generally not the most comfortable or healthy choice to stare at a small screen for hours at a time.",N/A,-1,-1
Jaunt gets that.,N/A,-1,-1

In those cases he said Universal Service Funds should help offset those costs to ensure that we don t get a digital divide between rural America and everywhere else.,America,25,25
"The principles aside, Wheeler also derided the agency s current definition of broadband at 4 Mbps.",Wheeler,4,4
"Speaking of the chart higher up in the story, he said:

He went further, indicating that 25 Mbps was really the current  tablestakes  goal for minimum broadband and pointed out that while a majority of American homes have access to 100 Mbps broadband, 40 percent do not.",N/A,-1,-1
"He called that unacceptable, while essentially tossing the efficacy of DSL lines out the window as a quality broadband option.",N/A,-1,-1
"The telcos have known this for more than a decade, but only when the threat of competition from cable companies deploying faster speeds and now Google s gigabit plans have prompted them to move faster in upgrading their networks.",N/A,-1,-1
"The Chairman said essentially the same things the Gig.U report I covered last month said: that gigabit isn t just fast, but it s spurring competitive investment that otherwise may never have happened.",N/A,-1,-1
"Wheeler likely irked the telco s further in explaining that mobile broadband isn t an adequate substitute for fixed broadband,  especially given mobile pricing levels and limited data allowances.",Wheeler,0,0
"We ve said this all along, and it s not like agency hasn t realized this for years, but saying it so publicly is a nice first step.",N/A,-1,-1
"So what s driving Wheeler to tell off the industry his agency regulates  My guess is that he realizes that creating any kind of meaningful network neutrality is impossible, so he has to go for the nuclear option.",Wheeler,4,4
"Not reclassification, but calling out the industry for the lack of competition that is why we need network neutrality in the first place.",N/A,-1,-1
"This is the first of several speeches the FCC will offer on this topic, we ll have to wait and see how the agency lines up its ideals on competition with policy-making.",N/A,-1,-1
It s much harder to say all of these things and then approve a merger that would put more American s under a broadband data cap and reduce the number of wireline broadband competitors or say no to a request to broaden the options businesses have for faster broadband access.,N/A,-1,-1
"But the chairman was also very clear that he s aiming to incentive competition, not mandate it.",N/A,-1,-1
Which means the behind-the-scenes negotiations between the agency and the ISPs may put the lie to Chairman s pro-competition rhetoric today in ways the average citizen won t see or understand until they are stuck paying $90 a month for 50 Mbps broadband that comes with a data cap.,N/A,-1,-1
Your website is part of a  marketing cloud.,N/A,-1,-1
"In this case, we re not talking about a product from Adobe or Salesforce.com, but the combination of all those marketing technologies used to drive traffic to   and monitor the performance of   your site.",N/A,-1,-1
"Most companies use a half-dozen technology and analytics providers, and advertising and affiliate partners are using even more.",Most,0,0
"Is this a net positive for your own objectives, or is the overhead of all these technologies dragging down site performance and leaking valuable data

"On Thursday, LG representatives told the Wall Street Journal that the smartwatch with round, plastic OLED display will become available in retail stores on October 14.",Wall,7,7
The company hasn t announced a price yet but did suggest that it will be more expensive than the currently available LG G Watch.,N/A,-1,-1
That watch costs $229 so it s a safe bet we ll see the new  R  model priced at $249 or higher.,N/A,-1,-1

Internet of things networking startup Sigfox just got into the burglar alarm business.,N/A,-1,-1
"On Thursday it announced a deal with Securitas Direct, the biggest provider of home and business security systems in Europe, to connect millions of alarms in Spain to its pervasive wireless network.",Spain,28,28
"Sigfox doesn t run the kind of wireless network used to connect mobile phones, tablets and laptops.",N/A,-1,-1
"Rather, with the help of telco partners, it is building a specialized network optimized for the internet of things in countries around the world.",N/A,-1,-1
The types of devices it connects only access the network intermittently and send minuscule amounts of data.,N/A,-1,-1
"Think sensors, industrial appliances, even dog collars.",N/A,-1,-1
Securitas Direct will basically use the Sigfox networks as a redundant network for notifying its monitoring centers when an alarm has been tripped.,N/A,-1,-1
Typically security companies rely on phone lines (which can be cut) and GSM networks (which can get overloaded or go down) for such emergency communication.,N/A,-1,-1
"By adding Sigfox as a backup, Securitas customers get extra assurance that the authorities will be contacted when an alarm goes off even if the primary telephone networks are down, said Thomas Nicholls, head of communications for Sigfox.",Nicholls,34,34

"Its first announced customer in the U.S. is quantified canine gadget maker Whistle Labs, which is using Sigfox s network to keep tabs on pooches when they stray from their owners.",N/A,-1,-1
But Nicholls said Sigfox is in discussion with several other device makers and internet companies.,Nicholls,1,1
"The Securitas Direct deal, however, is Sigfox s largest by far, piling millions of new connections onto its network in a short period of time.",N/A,-1,-1
Securitas s alarms are already equipped with radios that tap the 868 MHz bands used for many industrial communications purposes in Europe.,N/A,-1,-1
"That s the same band used by Sigfox s network, so to upgrade millions of alarms already in the field, Securitas need only send out a software update, Nicholls said.",Nicholls,31,31
"We often think of smartwatches, health trackers and connected consumer appliances when we think of the internet of things, but there s an industrial internet world whose operation won t be obvious to the general public but could become far bigger than the consumer internet of things.",N/A,-1,-1

"Have you ever connected an Android phone or tablet to a Chromebook  If so, you know what happens: Pretty much nothing.",N/A,-1,-1
That s right; you can t transfer files between the two Google devices.,N/A,-1,-1
"To get files from an Android device you either need to share them in the cloud, email them or use a computer.",N/A,-1,-1
"Google is in the process of getting these two platforms to talk together, however.",N/A,-1,-1
"Android Police noticed that the latest Chrome OS beta version adds MTP support, letting you connect an Android device to a Chromebook so you can see and transfer files between them.",Police,1,1
"MTP has long been used with Android for file transfers; it s the method used between Android and Windows or Android and Mac OS X, for example.",N/A,-1,-1
"Unfortunately, up to now MTP support wasn t part of Google s Chrome OS.",N/A,-1,-1
If you switch to the beta channel on your Chromebook you can get an early look at the function and start transferring files over USB.,N/A,-1,-1
"Those feeling less adventurous can simply wait for the function to arrive in the stable channel of Chrome OS, which is generally updated every six weeks.",N/A,-1,-1
"This official update follows another scenario that eliminates the need for a traditional computer when tinkering with Android: Last week, an experimental method to use the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) server tool arrived for Chromebooks.",N/A,-1,-1
With that you can send commands from a Chromebook to a USB-connected Android device for flashing software or modifying features.,N/A,-1,-1
"Between these two new developments, there s less reason than ever to need a full computer in Google s world.",N/A,-1,-1
