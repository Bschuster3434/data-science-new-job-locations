PROJECT 1

Identify the location of new DS jobs in the US.

Data was scrapped using 'import.io' from LinkedIn's Job Search Page.

Search Term Used was 'Data Science'.

Cities were choosen based on my preference to move there.

--RESULT--

After testing, I dumped my results into 'result_set.csv'

It appears that by both population density and total jobs available,
San Jose is the best place to look for work as a new data scientist.
Five of the top six jobs were directly related to DS and they have 
3,355 postings total, constituting nearly 10% of all Data Science
job placements.

Followed closely by San Jose is San Francisco, on the other side of
Palo Alto. After that, the order goes as follows:

3) New York
4) Boston
5) Seattle
6) Chicato
7) Los Angeles
8) Atlanta
9) Philadelphia

After Philadelphia, the number of relevant postings and jobs decrease
dramatically,
