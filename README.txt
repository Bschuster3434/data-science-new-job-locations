Data Science New Job Locations

----------------------------------------

This Project is to indentify metrics on where the best places to live would
be to start a company or find work as a data scientist. Parts of the project:

1) Using LinkedIn jobs page to indentify to places to work
2) Using INC 5000 to indentify cities with fast growing businesses

PROJECT 1

Identify the location of new DS jobs in the US.

Data was scrapped using 'import.io' from LinkedIn's Job Search Page.

Search Term Used was 'Data Science'.

Cities were choosen based on my preference to move there.

--RESULT--

After testing, I dumped my results into 'result_set.csv'

It appears that by both population density and total jobs available,
San Jose is the best place to look for work as a new data scientist.
Five of the top six jobs were directly related to DS and they have 
3,355 postings total, constituting nearly 10% of all Data Science
job placements.

Followed closely by San Jose is San Francisco, on the other side of
Palo Alto. After that, the order goes as follows:

3) New York
4) Boston
5) Seattle
6) Chicato
7) Los Angeles
8) Atlanta
9) Philadelphia

After Philadelphia, the number of relevant postings and jobs decrease
dramatically,

PROJECT 2

Rank top cities by the number of INC 500 companies located within r
miles of the city center.

--RESULT--

Overall, The top cities are very similar to the top cities in Project 1.
In order, the top INC 5000 cities within 30 miles are:

1) Washington, DC
2) New York, NC
3) Chicago, IL
4) Atlanta, GA
5) Los Angeles, CA
6) Boston, MA
7) San Francisco, CA
8) Philadelphia, PA
9) San Jose, CA
10) Seattle, WA

When looking industry specific, there are certain cities that seem to have
specialities, San Francisco and San Jose Included. There are a few cities
that appear 'well rounded', including WAshington, DC, Chicago, IL,
New York, NY and Boston, MA.

I will continue to analyze my results in excel, particularly industry specifc
INC 5000 businesses.

In the future, I would attempt to find a better measure than city, state
coordinates to track businesses. These numbers are estimates of the city
state coordiantes, which could be largely different than where a particular
business is located. Going forward, I would use actual addresses to re-do this
analysis.
